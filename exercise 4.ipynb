The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.The next issue is the humor, which didn\\'t land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn\\'t her normal \"loud\" self that\\'s supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn\\'t ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.Finally, the third act is weak. There\\'s a balancing problem with stakes. You can\\'t feel tension or weight to any action. And there\\'s a lot of superficial \"I can\\'t do it\" until they can.In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn\\'t feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn\\'t feel like a comic book. It\\'s more generic than that.',\n",
              " 'The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded \"deux-ex machina\" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that\\'s what happens when you get the 2021 \"Mortal Kombat\", \"WW84\" and \"The Expendables\" writers).Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst \"acting\" I\\'ve ever seen and a same type of joke (\"awkward nonsense\") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the \"Shang-Chi world\" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers.',\n",
              " \"Martial arts meets the MCU in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. More Crouching Tiger than Jackie Chan, the plot for the film is kinda hum-drum, the sort of mystical Eastern fantasy cobblers that practically writes itself.Shang-Chi is the son of immortal, power-hungry warlord Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and Li (Fala Chen), a warrior woman from the hidden village of Ta Lo. After falling in love with Li and becoming a father, Wenwu gives up his wicked ways and packs away the ten legendary rings that gave him much of his power. However, after his wife is killed by his old enemies, Wenwu once again wears the rings and trains his son to become an assassin. Ashamed of what he has become, Shang-Chi goes into hiding in America and becomes Shaun (Simu Liu), but his past eventually catches up with him when his father sends his army, The Ten Rings, to steal the pendants given to him and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) by their mother. Wenwu requires both pendants to reveal the way to Ta Lo, where he believes that his wife is being held captive by her people.This Marvel movie is at its most fun before the plot starts to get in the way and the CGI becomes too overbearing and intrusive: the early fight scenes - a battle on a runaway bus against a henchman known as Razor Fist, and a fight on some high-rise bamboo scaffolding - deliver lots of impressively choreographed action that will please both martial arts fans and superhero addicts. Awkwafina, as Shang-Chi's loyal friend Katy, provides some comic relief, but also gets stuck in with the action.Unfortunately, the film quickly goes downhill after the good guys make their way to Ta Lo, with a little help from Tony Slattery (see Iron Man 3) and a furry winged creature with no face. The inevitable battle between the villagers and Wenwu's army is typical overblown Marvel mayhem, but the massive CGI tsunami arrives when Wenwu opens the inter-dimensional gate that he thinks is holding Li prisoner: instead of releasing his wife, he frees a swarm of flying tentacled soul-suckers and their big bad boss The Dweller. Fortunately for the Ta Lo people, they have a massive magical dragon on their side, which wakes up and adds to the digital whizz-bangery.As technically impressive as the special effects are, I found the second half of the film visually overwhelming yet remarkably uninvolving - a whirlwind of pixels and noisy action without much substance.5/10. It was nice to see HK/Chinese stars Michelle Yeoh, Tony Leung and Yuen Wah together in a Marvel movie; I just wish it had been a better one.\",\n",
              " 'I\\'ll be honest - Marvel movies are not in my top 20 or even 50 but within the Marvel \"Universe\" I would say that Shang-Chi is in my top 5. I know, it\\'s blasphemy and all that but think about it - is it better than Iron Man? I would admit yes - it\\'s origin story is arguably better, and it\\'s characters are a lot deeper. The Mandarin is a conflicted man, with evil but good as well, like real life. Is this movie better than The Avengers or Ragnarok or Infinity Wars? Hard to say, which means it\\'s right up there with the best (of Marvel) in my opinion.Plus, I\\'m a sucker for Chinese movies with the Chinese language being spoken - 1 of my favourite of all times, if not my absolute favourite, is of course \\'Hero.\\' The Chinese language and the artistry of it\\'s culture are magnificent.All in all, well done Marvel, director Destin, and all those who worked to make this movie a reality. This is not just your average summer action movie; it\\'s close to being a Masterpiece. And the humour is pretty swell too!Cheers.',\n",
              " 'Shang-Chi is a boring film. The characters were okay, but the story was choppy and confusing. The song choices were odd. Plus, this movie was way too long. And the scene at the end had me practically falling asleep.',\n",
              " \"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.\",\n",
              " \"Everything comes in it beautiful science fiction and beautiful mythical creatures. Sometimes you have creatures that don't seem real, but these just seemed real. Well done! There was a bit of avatar feeling in it. Fighting for the safekeeping of peace. Really beautiful. And self-acceptance was also nicely incorporated.\",\n",
              " \"Sorry for the delay.Here we go...I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealousI'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plotTHOR Loki daddy issue\\nBlack Panta daddy issues\\nStark Daddy issues\\nStar lord Daddy issues\\nUltron daddy issues\\nNebula and Gamora daddy issues\\nShang daddy issue\\nWasp daddy issues\\nScott langs daughter Daddy issuesNo one has mommy issues.Don't watch this movie.\",\n",
              " \"Shang-Chi is one of Marvel Comic's most unknown and underutilized characters in their comics, with his original comics containing a decent amount of racist imagery and embarrassing caricatures of various Asian stereotypes. At it's best, the MCU can turn any obscure group or concept from the comics into gold, and Shang-Chi is no different.Shang-Chi might be one of the best examples of an idea that's actually better on film than the original source material, with the character's relationships, motivations, and place in the overall Marvel Universe all being improved upon in the film adaptation as opposed to the comics where he's mainly a hand-to-hand expert with no powers or special weapons, and isn't generally of much value to The Avengers.Simu Liu is charismatic and athletically gifted enough to do solid justice to the lead role. I hope the sequel gives him even more to do with his character and his legacy, but for an introduction, this was great. Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and of course the legendary Tony Leung all lend their talents to a great cast of characters.Wen Wu is easily one of the top villain/antagonist characters in the MCU and probably all of comic book films. He's intimidating and masterful as a ruler, but heartfelt and believable as a family man. His presence elevates the entire production as he's a legend of cinema.There's moments reminiscent of Black Panther, and the third act gets heavy into Chinese mythological imagery, but understand that this is not only meant as a superhero movie, but also a love-letter to Chinese storytelling and culture.Shang-Chi features some of the best physical/non-super powered fight scenes in the MCU, with the choreography and the cinematography of said action taking a higher level. As soon as I saw the bus fight scene in the opening I had no worries about this part of the movie.The Ten Rings themselves are not a weapon used in the comics, and are a wonderfully creative, versatile, and visually stunning weapon unlike anything I've ever seen before, and that's not an easy thing to say having seen as much comic book and sci-fi material as me.Some of the pacing and character development could be a little better, but overall Shang-Chi is on the higher end of Marvel movies, and can also be solidly enjoyed by audiences totally unfamiliar with Marvel in general.\",\n",
              " \"Movie has a lot of stuff to keep you hooked.1. VFX. Whole movie is visually stunning\\n2. Stunt choreography is awesome. Probably the best in MCU so far imo.3. Background score. I felt goosebumps everytime the main theme kicks in. Soundtrack is good too.4. Decent acting except the one who played Shang chi's father who had a menacing screen presenceDespite of the perfectly blended Chinese culture and the MCU's successful (so far) action formula, this movie isn't free from cliche moments. I just wished the second half was less predictable and had something more to offer.\",\n",
              " \"Watched the IMAX version! Best solo since Iron Man (2008)! I had no expectations of this before. But the movie is much more lively. Enjoyed every moment. And also very engaging from start to finish. A kinda Cute-Action movie with some fun stuff!This is the first movie that focuses more on martial arts than Marvel's superpower thing. Love to see a mix of Marvel's MASTER-LEVEL-CGI with Martial art. Kung-Fu with this kind of visual effect! Marvel nailed it again.I've always loved Marvel's casting. Katy is too perfect for her role. Loved her chemistry with Shaun. Also laughed out loud at her childish stuffs.Just one thing, not a big deal, the action scene of 'Dragon Riding' doesn't fit into the usual Marvel movie. But as Chinese flavor, it is OK. Except for this, the cinematography and VFX are a lot mesmerizing!\",\n",

              " \"Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view. It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.\",\n",

But there was something unfinished about this movie and I'm not sure what it is.

The fight scenes were great though, especially the final grand battle scene.\",\n",
              " \"I love all the movies from them but Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is one of my favorite marvel movies, it really managed to make a very nice movie, the story is usually a gorgeous one, the characters are very nice and you become very invested in the movie.I was amazed at what good fight sequences are in the movie like this, the best since The Avengers 2012 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier 2014 maybe even better.The CGI is incredible, I only saw such special effects on Avatar.I have to say that I ran and saw the fight on the bus 5 times, it's awesome ... it manages to give you an energy boost, so cool\\nThe story is extraordinary, Shang-Chi confronts the past he thought he left behind, when his father wants to reunite his lost family.Xu Wenwu played by Tony Leung is such a good villain, you understand why he does this, you empathize with him and although you know that the way he acts is wrong you understand his pain. Besides being a villain he is also my father and everything he wants to release his wife.A very good villain, certainly one of the best villains of this year.This movie blow me away, I love it.

It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc. Simu Liu has a strong presence as Shang-Chi, yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co-stars.\",\n",

Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.\",\n",

So, I'll just say that it looked great and would have been great to have seen it on the big screen.

Then the action dipped a little in the middle. But, once Shang Chi and his gang escaped the stronghold of the 10 rings, the movie really took off. It was a magnificent freaking story. The legend, the fighting, the story, and the tremendous acting were all there. This is as good an MCU movie as there ever was. I was totally blown away by it. It was a great idea to have top actors in the movie and let them do their thing. The leads Simu Liu and Akwafina are solid but the burden of carrying the movie isn't entirely placed on their shoulders.

Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.\",\n",

              " 'I\\'ve said this before about Marvel movies: they are a victim of their own success. \"Shang-Chi\" had to follow up a decade and a half of quality MCU movies, so the same movie that would\\'ve been a smash 10 years ago isn\\'t viewed quite the same today. The movie was good, but it failed to really separate itself.\"The Legend of Ten Rings\" as a title already sounds too much like LOTR. And in fact it was something like it in that he with the rings had the power. Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) had the ten rings which gave him near omnipotence. With the ten rings he could defeat entire armies and live forever. He decided to use the rings to become a tyrant.He was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life, a woman he found after living 1000 years. I thought it was a bit strange that it took the man 1000 years to find his true love, but I didn\\'t dwell on it.Stranger than him taking a thousand years to find his true love was the woman who fell in love with him. She lived in a secret magical village in Macao that was totally isolated from the rest of the world. She was a gentle benign character who had powers herself and was able to defeat Wenwu when he came to essentially conquer her village. Somehow, through their Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-esque battle they fell in love. Maybe that makes sense for him being that he finally found someone who could defeat him, but it didn\\'t make sense for this nearly pure woman to fall for a man with a 1000 year history of tyranny.Still, they wed, forsook their powers and started a family.Their family would be unceremoniously destroyed when an old foe of Wenwu--a vicious gang--came by their house to get their pound of flesh and killed Wenwu\\'s wife, Li (Fala Chen). Li could\\'ve attempted to barter with them for some sort of material exchange for their past losses, but instead she immediately decided she\\'d try to fight the entire gang and lost her life in the process. That would cause Wenwu to don the ten rings again and return to tyranny.So, if you\\'re keeping score on Wenwu\\'s wife, 1.) she was smitten with a man who came to destroy her village and 2.) she chose to fight an entire gang with no powers to speak of and with no attempts to negotiate.I recognize that it was a plot device to advance the plot, but it could\\'ve been done a lot better and with more tact. Her character never struck me as someone impulsive and/or not able to judge character yet she exhibited both flaws.Most of what I\\'ve covered was garnered throughout the movie via flashbacks. The real main character was Saun aka Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). He was the son of Wenwu and Li. Years later we see an adult Saun. He lives in SF and is a valet. He is violently thrust back into the life he ran away from when his father\\'s goons came for the pendant around his neck given to him by his mother. It was at this point we learned his backstory, of which I\\'ve given some already. We find out he also has a sister, Xialing (Meng\\'er Zhang), who Disney not so subtly informed us she had to train herself to become a fierce warrior because of her gender. The two of them had been split up for close to twenty years when Saun ran away after being trained to be an assassin by his father. He was fourteen at the time and she was ten when he promised her he\\'d be back. He never came back and when they met again in Macao as adults she held the same ten-year-old bitterness against him for running away as though a fourteen-year-old should\\'ve been more reliable. She greeted him with a butt-kicking that was twenty years in the making. It\\'s clear that it never crossed her mind that he may have been killed, or maybe she would\\'ve considered his death a betrayal as well. Either way it was a completely childish way to handle reuniting with your long lost brother.The two of them would join forces along with Saun\\'s friend Katy (Awkwafina) and really quickly to stop their father. He was going to use the ten rings to breach a portal to another dimension which contained some soul-sucking demons.The introduction of demons to the movie did offer some excitement. It upped the stakes of everyone involved and thrust another Marvel character into the role of saving the world.Saun would save the world with the help of his friends and family. Some would die, but the most important characters lived. I was somewhat satisfied with the movie. The acting was commendable and Awkwafina was good as the comic relief. \"Shang-Chi\" may just be the placement of a singular brick to build to something bigger, I just hope what Marvel is building towards is worth it.',\n",

It didn't live up to all the hype and all the praise but seemed very much like any other Marvel movie. But what I am truly impressed with, was the blend of martial arts in the MCU, it fit so perfectly. This wasn't just another movie with a sprinkle of Asian characters for representation, no this actually tells their story, speaks their language, and depicts the details. The fight scenes are fun, there is some light comedy, no gore, and the CGI was gooooood. The backstory and narration made the fantasy seem real.It pulled at my heartstrings when it connected to Iron Man, I did not see that coming though it certainly made up for my disappointment with Awkwafina (Katy). The movie had a lot of slow parts and parts where I was losing interest and seemed somewhat like a good vs evil movie? Come to think of it, it felt like a Disney movie trying to teach me about Asian cultures and the inherent good in the universe.I'll agree it was dramatic and stays with you as 20 minutes post the movie, I was trying to channel the universe with open palms and gentle hand motions. Not something I do every day.\",\n",
              " 'I thought this movie would suck honestly when i heard it was being made, i thought shang chi is a terrible character with no powers and then i always dread hollywood making asian movies lol.Im chinese by the way and when i finally watched it i was blown away!!! This was best movie of the year, maybe one of the best marvel movies that didnt involve a blockbuster teamup like avengers infinity wars and end game.So action packed, excellent script, insane graphic visuals, insane fighting choreography, alot of character depth and explorations. Well made indeed! This is the Black panther movie for all asians! I say all asians because chinese culture has affected all asian countries in the last 3000 years.Dont let the reviews bother you, alot of these people dont know what their talking about honestly. Seen 1 person mention theirs no villain But this movie takes villain into an indepth look. For every villain theirs a drive & purpose to why they do things and for this villain it involved love. Some may not be able to comprehend this as they view villains stone cold killers maybe or just destructive no emotion type of baddies.They wrote the script for this villain amazingly considering he was originally the Mandarin (a very stereotypical villain hated by asians). The clever way they were able to remove that racist heritage to this character was flawless, funny and amazing.I mean cmon it was hilarious the way the villain described how his name came.Some even complained they got lost during the whole movie which i found it hard to believe. I mean you must have Low IQ lmao go not understand n follow through the movie. From beginning to end it was a step through step process. Maybe they could have explored more about the magical lands but whois to say they wont in future movies?? All u needed to know was in the movie, and any other questions can be saved for the future just as most marvel movies always do.The fight scenes on the Bus were off the charts and so was the rest of it. I can see theirs many chinese people hating on this film cuz they feel the fighting style is too like Chinese movies fighting style But they dont get it. What made this movie very good was the amazing way they blended chinese and western movies together. The fight scenes was neither just chinese nor was it western, it was a perfect blend.This stories villajn was writting the way Thanos was but better. Thanos was not just crazy mad villain, he had purpose and feelings and goals that involved not just world domination or killing. Same with this villain, Tony Leung may have had not many lines in this movie but the way he carried his presence and the acting was outstanding.I have watched tony leung in hong kong movies for 30 years now and his acting is impeccable. He brought life to the Villain he played, and gave it a more down to earth and also relatable character portrayal. Anyone in his position in the movie would have had a chance to go his path, i know many might disagree but it was so easy to see how he deviated from the good path he took for some time back to evil. You just need to understand the character and his reasons and experiences.The main character Sima Liu i mean was pretty good choice, their were some scenes for fighting that looked to be him doing the stunts and it was amazing.I seen some complain that the movie should have been just mandarin but thats clearly a comment made by someone from China or mandarin speaking. To them they live in the old age where black is black, white is white, theirs no grey.Only way asians can move forward in hollywood is by a blend of both west n east.Maybe some people might hate it cause its so much asian characters n that its got mandarin language in it, then u got others who hate it cuz theirs english in it. Both groups need to grow up and live in the year 2021 cuz this movie was so successful because of the mixture of both cultures in 1.If this movie was just another straight chinese martial arts flick it would certainly not be successful in the west. This blend is what makes it open up to other races to watch and enjoy.The special effects of the movie was off the charts! Amazing!! The fighting too!This movie is the Black panther for asians. Its the opening door for asians to be introduced more commonly.If anyone in or from China reads this i think u should think hard to yourself, Do you want to see more chinese movies succeed in the future?? Cuz if so then u should ccheer this movie on cause its gonna open doors for chinese actors n actresses.China blocking this movie from playing makes no sense as the way for China to spread love is share their culture with all especially after the pandemic fiasco. This movie opens the doors of chinese culture up to westerners.So support this movie! And stop bashing it for unfounded selfish reasons.',\n",

Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese. I'm not sure why Ben Kingsley as the fake 'Mandarin' from IRON MAN 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the MCU.

So for me it kinda felt totally fantastical and not really connected to any of the other Marvel universe.The fight and chorography of the action scenes is impressive and entertaining and if a movie could be watched on that basis alone then this would do the job - unfortunately for Shang Chi you actually need a compelling story with interesting characters.... but what we got was the MASSIVELY overdone .. evil father and son who seeks redemption arc... other supporting characters were pretty much all one dimensional - either good or bad, black or white.I also felt that Samuel Liu was miscast in the main role...

I'd slightly fallen out of my obsession with the MCU over the past couple of years, but Shang-Chi could help bring my obsession back.It's about so many things at once, but the main plot is basically about Shang-Chi trying to find family with his friend Katie. That's the best way to describe it without minor spoilers. I believe this film really represented the culture well, and the scenery really helped to intrigue me to keep watching longer. The characters are all pretty likeable too and the fight scenes were amazing!A criticism I would have, which I have with many Marvel films, is that I feel like some scenes dragged on a little too long, but that's me really picking in details. I also found it hard to follow the plot at one point, but I soon picked back up what was happening.I really recommend this, even if you're not a fan of the MCU.

              " '\"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" is one of the best productions of Marvel Studios. I had very big expectations for this movie and it didn\\'t disappoint, mostly because it\\'s based on asian people and martial arts and I am a very big fan of this genre. Only the idea to make a Marvel\\'s movie which is based on martial arts is very interesting, even If there are already some comics on which this movie is based on.The movie has all you could expect from a movie made of Marvel, but the special effects and the CGI are the strongest points of this one. I even regret it that I didn\\'t watch it in a cinema, because it\\'s clear that the movie has been made to put into the light the enormous ammount of special effects, on a big screen. I\\'ve also been impressed by the acting and even the storyline it\\'s not bad. It\\'s clear enough that is has been put a lot of effort in the well-making of this movie and it seems to me that they really achieved what they\\'ve wanted to.\"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" it\\'s a movie that shines through it\\'s CGI, acting and storytelling.',\n",
              " \"I've watched this movie twice so far and I thought I'd enjoy it less on the rewatch, but I found it just as good.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a very epic introduction to this character and keeps you invested in his origin story. While it's definitely not the most original story, they do a good job at making the character relatable enough to keep you emotionally invested.Awkwafina was a nice addition to the movie and while some of her jokes were pretty corny, they still made me laugh (even on rewatch).The highlights of the movie are definitely the bus scene near the beginning and the final beautiful action sequence. But all the action in general in this movie is pretty amazing.While it has a different vibe than most MCU movies, the formula is definitely still there. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it would have been nice for this movie to have a bit more of a unique story.Otherwise this is a stunning cinema experience, and even watching at home it will make you feel like you're in a movie theatre. Definitely recommend!\",\n",
              " \"I was excited for Shang-Chi. Infinity War and Endgame set the bar very high at the end of Phase 3. The MCU shows have been a mixed bag but Shang-Chi seemed exciting because the director has a decent track record and I hadn't heard of the character. I thought it would be a good way for the MCU to expand.But this is one of the most by-the-numbers superhero movies I've ever seen. Practically everything about it falls flat or feels superficial. The humour is obvious and lazy. The fighting is cool but the camera is too hyperactive to let me properly enjoy it. The CGI is over-used and seldom feels remotely convincing nor interesting.Although there's some backstory, it's boring and confusing. It's one thing to be told what happened in the past. It's much better if we understand why choices were made and feel the passage of time.As it is, I didn't relate to any of the characters much at all. Shaun and Katy are just annoying and frivolous. The villain is stubborn and not particularly intimidating. I probably liked Kingsley more than anyone else and his character could easily be removed without affecting the plot.The staging is incredibly artificial. So many shots contain characters simply standing in a line. Or walking in a line. It never feels natural. One part has the bad guys (Are they bad guys? Who cares?) park their jeeps in a row and then get out and stand in a row while the other army stand in, you guessed it, a row. This keeps happening.Some of the creature designs are kind of cool, like the dragons which look like stylised drawings rather than real creatures. But they lead nowhere. They aren't developed, nor hyped up before, just thrown in your face. Including the massive dragons at the end. To make a fight between giant, flying dragons boring is quite the achievement, but Shang-Chi pulls it off.Cliches abound in this bore-fest. The comedic relief sidekick learns archery in a day or two and saves the day with a ridiculous shot. Why didn't any of the archers who had years of training do the same thing? How can an arrow travel that far so easily? It cheapens everything. They didn't earn it, they just did it because that's what movies do, right?The physics are awful. Why do I care? Well, reality matters. I much prefer movies where things actually make sense than those where the pixels are having a seizure, characters say one-liners and there are no stakes or consistency at all. Ignoring physics means making up random events with no real danger, suspense or skill, on the part of the characters or the screenwriters.Shang-Chi is one of the most superficial movies I've seen for a while. Great entertainment for 10-year-olds, perhaps, but utterly dull to most true movie enthusiasts. The moments are forced and predictable. There's no magic, the music's forgettable, the acting and script tick boxes rather than engage you.At best, it has some colourful action and a few funny lines. It shows just how skillfully made good action movies are, including the Russo brothers MCU movies.\",\n",

              " 'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is the 25th MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movie which also has the 1st major Asian representation in the MCU.I loved the film because it had an amazing story filled with a lot of elegant, eye-pleasing scenes and super awesome crazy action scenes such as the bus fight. The movie also includes amazing martial art techniques and beautiful Chinese things too.This film doesn\\'t have recognizable adult stuff and very violent action scenes as many of the previous MCU productions had, which makes the film, \"Shang-Chi\" suitable even for younger kids like age 10. I didn\\'t even feel the time passing by when I was watching this film because the story had an amazing flow with the stuff I mentioned before. I can\\'t say anything else about the movie as I might include spoilers.Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is an amazing, beautiful, action packed movie for the start of major Asian representations in the MCU.',\n",
              " 'So, the fighting scenes were good, cgi not bad, chemistry in the movie between the cast were near absent, woowoo had an arc just for the big final fight to happen but whatever,Movie is a 7 at best, but i removed 2 stars because,KATYwhat in the ass donkey is this character,\\nso annoying, every scene she is in just drains your brain.Even the voice, like woman, clear your throat or stop smoking or something ffs, feels like it was the only other asian chick available in wokewood.',\n",
              " \"I liked the first half of this film and I thought it was a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The backstory with the father and the mother was a nice wuxia inspiration and a cool way of introducing the Chinese theme to Marvel. The protagonist and Awkwafina had a believable friendship that struggled to balance enjoyment with living up to expectations. The tensed family relationship was a great focus as the father's gravity and charisma almost matched that of Thanos and feels like a truly deep human being. Throughout, the fight choreography was amazing, especially the bus scene.The second half was an obligatory CGI mess that takes the focus away from the family relationship. The epic legendary city of Ta Lo (Chinese version of Wakanda) is about thirty people living in a wooden village. That's all that stands between the world and a world-destroying demon, apparently. The hyped up final battle involves about ten soldiers with tasers. Wasn't the Ten Rings supposed to be a world-spanning empire? The fight between the dragons was so fast-paced that I couldn't tell what was going on.That said, there are flaws that occur in both of the halves. The Ten Rings (the organisation) is very vague in its nature and impact. Why are they so feared? How have they taken over the world? What are they capable of? Show, don't tell! The Ten Rings (the artifacts) don't seem to do much beyond flying around and projecting energy. This is cool, but it seems like a step down from other cosmic jewellery and probably didn't deserve the praise in the post-credit scenes.P. S. Trevor and Morris were definitely highlights of the film! Keep this up, Marvel!\",\n",
              " \"Suffice to say, I enjoy all sorts of superhero movies. They're just so colorful with everyone dressed in otherworldly costumes and above all that, I even get to see creatures which don't exist and would never in my lifetime anyway. Shang-Chi was slightly different in the sense that thought it started off showing the past of an immortal man, it moved to modern-day America and focused on two friends who were as normal as any millennial you'd meet outside on the streets today. It got wierd soon after though, as it should.My favourite part of the movie was how the redemption arc for Ten Rings worked out perfectly, he really wasn't that bad as a father to begin with.I'm looking forward to more from this franchise.\",\n",
              " \"This movie has some great action scenes things we haven't seen in a while and it's refreshing but this doesn't seem like a marvel movie at all. There is literally only two or three things linking it to the marvel universe. So, if you wanna watch it I recommend it but like I said don't look at it as a marvel movie. Also Trevor was fun to see again.\",\n",
              " \"I'm a big time marvel fan and would have anyway rated the movie good. But I genuinely loved the movie and instantly rewatched which I rarely do given the plethora of content available these days.I would even rate the movie better then endgame. It has more action and less talking.\",\n",
              " \"Truly an amazing movie! This movie depicts family very well. The visual effects are stunning, the martial arts are incredible, and there is just enough humor in it to relieve some of the darker notes. I can't wait for the sequel!\",\n",

              " \"Totally unpopular opinion here and I might be the only one, but I really didn't like it; even going into it with no expectations. I wasn't too keen on the movie in the first place, but I was swayed by everybody who watched it and said it was brilliant. What a mistake. I felt the movie was incredibly dull, generic, utterly cliched and stereotyped. Crap characters, formulaic plot, and not even all that funny. As soon as the movie opened with a Chinese battle banner and the twang of guzheng notes, I knew it would be bad. The action and fight scenes aren't even all that great: they relied way too much on CG. I feel like the action was nothing special: Jackie Chan (and Yuen Wah whom you'll see in Shang Chi) in his hey-day produced way better action and fights without CG. Back when The Matrix first came out, that was mind-blowing action that Western audiences haven't seen before. If you've seen any number of Hong Kong martial arts movies you'll know what I mean. The third act of the movie was a total rip-off of the last battle in How to Train Your Dragon. Also an absolute waste of great actors like Michelle Yeoh who was given nothing to do, she practically dialled in her part. Positives though: Tony Leung. He's the one redeeming grace of this terrible and lazy movie.\",\n",
              " 'This film manages to introduce the character in this universe, but the story that unfolds is boring.The conflict changes several times, it even takes the main character to a lake to concentrate on something else, it becomes cyclical, it is incongruous, it has many script holes, you do not feel much emotion when the fights appear. The visuals are very good, the editing is good most of the time, although the sound of some mythological elements is not very good, like the performance of the actor who plays the antagonist, the ending feels a bit forced.This film is not innovative in the genre and is predictable, making it somewhat boring.',\n",

              " \"The movie was entertaining to some degree and followed the standard Marvel Universe formula. Trite, current day pop cultural references and jokes during the first half of the movie were cheap and certainly will be lost on audiences of the future. A few idiots in the theatre guffawed loudly at most of them. As usual, though, the women were strong, kind and intelligent and the men were dumb and evil. Are we to believe that the most evil man in the Universe, Xi, is going to change his evil ways and that his wife would have even married a mass murderer on the scale of Genghis Kahn or Vlad the Impaler? Of course she's killed by his enemies and he returns to a life of evil and sends his henchmen to kill his own children to retrieve some necklaces so he can read a map. I will say Xi was a badass, as were Shang's sister, Aunt, and pretty much every other character compared to Shang, who was soft and definitely not superhero material. Awkwafina was funny and entertaining as usual, overshadowing Shang in most scenes as his character was so forgettably boring. Even his Aunt could kick his butt. Loved Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, extremely funny and his performance was genius. The outcome was the usual for Marvel Universe and even the pre-view for the next movie during the credits was lame; I guess they could only get Mark Ruffalo and Brie Larson, perhaps the only two Marvel Universe characters lamer than Shang, to set up the next movie.\",\n",

This movie does both perfectly, within the first 30 minutes we are drawn to Shang as a character and that lasts throughout the entire movie.

China did not allow their citizens to watch it. I guess Disney will have to put even more Anti American talk into the next movie.You messed up Star Wars Disney.

It has some great fight scenes with some incredible fight choreography and epic large-scale battles. It is also has some good comedic scenes that made me laugh a couple of times. Where Shang-Chi suffers is when it comes to the plot. I didn't find the story very compelling and I didn't get that attached to the characters. It's a story that I feel has been done many times before.Shang-Chi wasn't for me but it's comedy and fight scenes make up for some of it's flaws. If you are familiar with the Marvel franchise I assume you somewhat know what to expect and for you I can recommend it. Although the movie isn't that great, I still think it's good enough to the point of where it's worth watching just to keep up with the larger plot of the MCU.

It was so distracting. I wish things were shot on location. The green scene backgrounds were so obviously. The bus fight scene was boring because you could tell they were on a set with cgi roads and buildings in the back ground. The fight scenes are poorly edited and choppy. They are not coherent at all.

Shang-Chi is a pretty standard hero's journey at its core, which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by House of Flying Daggers and other wuxia titles.So why a rating so high? Because where the story falls, everything else excels.Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon.The fight scenes are all amazing. There's one weak fight, but it's meant to be weak, and they're all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing.The first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off.In summary, the story is lacking, but I'm glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did.

The magical elements in the movie were a refreshing change from all the aliens we've been seeing in Marvel movies lately. However, you can watch this movie without having seen any other Marvel movies before.The fight scenes were well choreographed, maybe almost too slick looking? They reminded me of Jackie Chan fights with how precise they were. Despite beating each other severely, no one seems to bleed in any of these fights, so it might have been better if it took the leap into R rating territory like Deadpool.Although some scenes had slightly janky looking CGI - it was only a little sub-par in places. The final action set-piece is epic though, proving Shiang Chi is a force to be reckoned with in the MCU.As with all the MCU movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously, with moments of humour. Although sometimes you'd wish they would be a bit more serious, I guess it's the MCU formula to add humour. It's reasonably well paced, although these movies are always longer than they need to be. Then you have to sit through end-credit scenes that hint at the mysterious origins of the 10 rings, and a potential sequel or tie in with another MCU movie.Overall, it's not bad, a good adventure, some good fights, and a BIG finish.\",\n",

Tony Leung is a legend and gives a wonderful performance as a complicated and tortured antagonist. There is great humor (not to everyone's liking it seems) and heart.

Was hoping this film, would have had a more grounded plot like Iron Man.',\n",
              " 'I had low expectations for this movie. First off, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. It\\'s so god damn beautifully well-done. The storyline is extremely brilliant where it explores how this man found the Ten Rings that gifted him with unlimited power and immortality that kept him alive for thousands of years, would create an organization known as the Ten Rings who would later be responsible for the Kidnapping of Tony Stark in Afghanistan, Aldrich Killian\\'s madness.After their job, the two ride on a bus, but only to encounter the Ten Rings and a guy with a \"freakin\\' machete\". I have to say, though. This scene\\'s choreography was god damn great, and the music made it even better. After the attack, Katy begins to question Shang\\'s motives. Shang explains the backstory of how he came to be, and that he needed to go visit his long-lost sister. They take the airplane to China. The two arrive in this underground fighting club that was broadcasted to the Dark Web only to encounter a guy who told him to sign to fight, even though Shang didn\\'t know what he was signing up for. We get to see a cameo of the Abomination fighting Wong. I have to say that the CGI was better on him in every level. I am quite glad that the writers are starting to acknowledge The Incredible Hulk. Shang is up to fight an unknown opponent, and it is revealed that it is his sister. Shang tries to talk to her that he doesn\\'t want to fight which basically led to him getting his *** kicked. (( Have to put asterisks so that IMDb won\\'t delete this review, so don\\'t be surprised. ))After the fight, Shang tells his sister, Xialing about the Ten Rings situation. They soon realize that the Ten Rings attack the club which leads us to another action scene. Unrelated, but I have noticed that people have been complaining that MCU Heroes don\\'t kill. I\\'m pretty sure that they did kill since the beginning where Iron Man used his Mark I to light his victims on fire, blowing up multiple people, fatal blasts, etc. The Death Dealer steals Xialing\\'s pendant, capturing the three of them to the Ten Rings Headquarters to reunite with their father waiting for them. Back at the Headquarters, Wenwu explains how there is still hope to save their mother by finding Ta Lo to save Ying. Wenwu uses the two pendants to place them on the dragon\\'s eyes generating a map made of water showing them the secret passage through the bamboo maze, and the perfect time where it can be granted. Wenwu tells them that if the people of Ta Lo won\\'t comply, he will burn down the village with no mercy. Shang is against this. Wenwu throws them in the catacombs. The three hear some weird noises only to encounter Trevor who was the Fake Mandarin in Iron Man 3! If you didn\\'t know, there was a short that explains Slattery\\'s experience in jail. In the end, he is captured by the Ten Rings. Morris comes out of the corner, telling Trevor the true path.Xialing discovers that there are escape routes, the team hijacks Razor\\'s car which leads us to another fight sequence. They soon approach the bamboo forest maze. Katy is assisted where to turn by Morris and Slattery. Finally, they enter a waterfall, arriving at the Ta Lo village. Guang Bo tells the group to turn back. Ying Nan delays that order, meeting her niece and nephew. Although, I did realize this was Michelle Yeoh who portrayed Philippa Georgiou in Star Trek: Discovery. I do need to catch up as I lost interest. Ying tells them a story where in ancient times, their village was attacked by this extra-dimensional draconic entity who can suck the ever-living souls out of people and its minions can, too. But, the Great Protector, and sealed away behind the Dark Gate, trapping it for many centuries. Here, we have a training montage where we see Shang-Chi being trained in the same arts that were used to defeat Wenwu, Xialing practices with this what seems to be a rope dart, and Chen learning archery. The next day, Wenwu and the Ten Rings, also Razor Fist, and the Death Dealer arrive. Nan tells Wenwu that his wife isn\\'t behind the Dark Gate, but the Soul Eaters were luring him to a trap.We begin the climactic third act. Nan fights with the Death Sealer, Xialing fights Razor Fist. Meanwhile, Shang notices his father walking away to his wife\\'s memorial, but is distracted by several warriors for a brief moment. As he approaches his father, he told him that he isn\\'t afraid. Episode V vibes here when Luke tells Yoda where he promises that he won\\'t fail him and not be afraid. \"Oh, you will be. You will be.\" They begin to fight until Wenwu uses the same movement that he killed the gang who killed his wife on Shang into the depths of water, believing that his son is dead. He does a Jedi Jump moment to the Dark Gates using the rings to break it down and free his wife. This makes the situation worse by releasing an army of Soul Eaters. In the village, Xialing tries to ally with Razor Fist to help to take down the Soul Eaters. His mind is changed when the Death Dealer\\'s soul was sucked out, he tells the Ten Rings to stop and help the villagers. I have to say, this part was terrifying and how he falls dead, no movement. It is crazy how death does that. Back to Shang-Chi, he regains consciousness with the help of the Great Protector rising out of the water. The Great Protector begins to eat the Soul Eaters. Shang-Chi makes his way to his father to furthermore convince him that his wife isn\\'t behind the Dark Gates. Wenwu ignores this, continuing the fight. Wenwu uses half of his rings at his son, but Shang catches them and gaining control of \\'em. The fight gets more intense to the point where the Dweller is unleashed and slowly absorbs Wenwu\\'s soul. During his final moments, he gives his son the rings. The battle suffered many losses including Master Guang Bo. Chen launches an arrow at the Dweller\\'s weak port, causing it to be weakened. The Great Protector starts to kick the ever-living crap outta it, making it explode. In the Aftermath, the villagers attend a ceremony as the lanterns of those who died slowly \"swam\" across the ocean. Finally, it was all about a true story where Shang was explaining his recent adventure to a couple. Obviously, they don\\'t believe him just until Wong uses his yellow sparkly thing bringing Shang and Katy to discuss the rings. We get a cameo of Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner. This time, Captain Marvel didn\\'t get another haircut, lol. Interesting how Professor Hulk somehow returned to his human form. I strongly assume that his right arm is more painful since he returned as a human. In the end credits, we see Xialing becoming the new leader of the Ten Rings.There are A LOT of fantastic characters here. Starting off with Shang-Chi, I have to say that he had an excellent performance where he seems to be brave, showing no cowardice to his father, has lovely chemistry with his best friend he had known for 10 years, Katy, wants nothing to do with his family, often feels guilty for leaving Xialing. I have to say, though. Speaking of Katy, I liked how she wasn\\'t full-on comedic throughout the film and became a badass. I do find it interesting that we have two archers now. Hawkeye and Katy. I quite like how we didn\\'t have any romance (( besides Wenwu\\'s romantic relationship with Ying Li. ))Wenwu. What to say on this. He is one of the best Marvel villains ever. Although, he wasn\\'t one, and he had actual motives rather than being the usual MCU villain, but the storytelling is wonderful. He was a ruthless leader killing multiple people. Then one day, he stumbled upon a woman, ditches away his organization, became a better caring & loving man to raise two children until his wife was killed, seeking revenge on her murder, became a flawed father having no time toward his children like ditching Xialing. What. A. Tragic. Story. I am starting to notice that Phase 4 is exploring the effects of grief like Wanda\\'s love for Vision, Sylvie\\'s hatred for the TVA, and Corrupted Doctor Strange trying to bring back his love. Tony Leung\\'s performance killed it. I loved how they were ditching away with the Mandarin stuff.I have to say that the Ten Rings (( no, not the organization. )) is completely badass, more interesting than the repulsors, the Mjolnir, Stormbreaker, a million-pound sharp-edged metal frisbee, the iconic Scepter, a cross-bow that can do many things, a prosthetic titanium/vibranium arm that can overpower almost anything, Quad Blasters that go pew pew, the Godslayer that can cut through anything, basic daggers, a laser cannon, yaka arrow that can travel by whistling, electroshock batons, carbon-fibered specialized winged jetpack, and vibranium claws. Wanda\\'s psionic energy manipulation, size/insect manipulation, web-shooters, eldritch magic, and the Infinity Gaunlet are the only cool things along with the Ten Rings. You can make an energy blast, put 10 rings on one arm to do a super-punch, extend into a energy whip, shields, big jumps, etc. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. The fight between Wenwu & Ying was god damn jaw-dropping. Wenwu is a 10/10 character.For Xu Xialing, she became likable in the later halfs of the movie. Her backstory is heartbreaking, because of her gender, she couldn\\'t train with her brother Shang. Although, she learned to train on her own. Rather than her unpleasant behavior, she has great bonds with women, emotional, a really interesting relationship with her brother. For Ying Nan, she is marvellous. She dealt with the loss of her sister, and wise. I enjoyed Guang Bo so much, he\\'s wise, has a deep heart for his village. I was devastated of his death. Trevor. I enjoyed so much for him and his deep relationship for Morris, he is so fun! \"Calm down, mate. I\\'m not actually dead, it\\'s just a performance, play along.\" I do wish that the Death Dealer was done better rather than being treated dirty. He was badass, completely threatening, and the same potential of Taskmaster. The movie has excellent pacing, that\\'s all I have to say.',\n",

Simu Liu will rightfully be a superstar because of his performance. I want to see more of Meng\\'er Zhang, I think that she has huge potential.

The use of mandarin (Chinese) in this film was spot on as well, though the translation could be better. I understand Chinese mandarin, and it was spot on. Only thing I ask of Marvel/Disney is somehow bring Tony Leung back. And maybe help the general public on how to properly pronounce Shang Chi. (Sh-on-Chi). Seriously, this movie was just like Black Panther, everything was spot on. I've seen this movie twice in theaters, and bought 4k collectors edition. Marvel/Disney, please continue to take my money.

I spent that time hoping that I could have the ability to skip 10 second at will like on YouTube. The second problem is the fact that Shang-Chi itself is not an interesting character as far as this movie treats him. He surely has potential and it is clear that Marvel will be high on him in the future and I still have hope but in this movie I think I preferred at least four characters more than him and he is the protagonist. And finally the plot has various holes, especially regarding the Ten Rings as a criminal organization.

Seemed like they put ghostrider and and iron fist together. The villige is K'un-Lun in a sense. Mystic village that is only accessible during a certain time period.

Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun's real name is Shang-Chi and he was trained from childhood to fight by his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who has been conquering for a thousand years with the Ten Rings until he met the love of his life, Shang-Chi's mother.This is MCU doing an Asian hero and it's actually pretty funny. Awkwafina does her comedic thing. Simu Liu does a good every-man performance but he's also a good straight man to Awkwafina. I like the pairing although they may be better as friends. Then the movie surprises with a comedic turn from Ben Kingsley. I love that part which gave the movie a comedic jolt. I wouldn't mind him popping up in other MCU stuff. The dragon fight is a little blah but those climatic battles are getting standardized anyways. This is a fine addition to the MCU and these are fun characters to add to the gang.\",\n",

I really wish they spoke more mandarin in specific scenes though. The English made scenes weak to me personally, idk being threatened in English didn't cut it, but when the villain threat the elder in mandarin, that hit different.Overall, I loved the movie and am so proud that an Asian protagonist is in the MCU.

It would have been better if It took place in the 70's and had more of an Enter The Dragon vibe. What we get is anything but. It has some good action scenes, the best being with Shang fighting men on a bus. But then it has Ben Kingsley who was out of place in it and a furry creature called Morris that was stupid and unnecessary and should have been ommitted from the movie. It's like a furry pig with wings with no head or face that makes sounds like an Ewok or Gizmo from Gremlins. So dumb. There are some amusing moments but then I find it irritating that something funny has to be thrown in at odd moments. Like most Marvel films. Give it a break. Please. The ending is something out of a Rodan, Godzilla movie. When watching this I thought is this really a Marvel movie or a B movie from made in Japan. I did like the first half of Shang Chi. The second half was just ok. I saw it free because I had a free ticket from my club card. I'm glad I did. Even when I saw the trailer I wasn't expecting anything. I can see why.

This phase seems completely relying on the success of the previous one. The only good thing is Spider-Man and I'm eagerly looking forward to No Way Home. After this I don't have any expectations from Marvel films other than Spider-Man.The humour in this movie is pure cringe. It feels too forced and Awkwafina is completely out of place. The last scene where they sing Hotel California is so damn cringy. It's a tragedy that they thought people would enjoy it. This is a really bad film minus the action sequences.

Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces.

The martial arts fight in public transport has been done to death (recently quite well in \"Nobody\", but also in Marvel films like Captain Marvel), and in general the fights pale against movies like Matrix, John Wick or any Jackie Chan classic.The reality is that Marvel movies feel dated and played out, with nowhere to go except from one CGI battle to the next.

It made less money at the worldwide box office than Godzilla versus Kong in the same \"pandemic era.\" The lead actor is boring in the film and pretentious outside the film...mocking fans, berating any constructive or genuine criticism, and spouting a bunch of foolishness on his social media that may get him canceled in the near future by one of the many angry Twittermobs. He basically is the male Brie Larson of the MCU. What could have been an action-packed, fun, exciting Kung Fu film in the MCU collapsed into a lame CGI-fest in the third act--think of the Dragon Ball Z or Avatar films that bombed at the box office. Once again, we had an overpaced origin story...watching Shang-Chi go from being an insecure valet, to getting kicked in the balls by his sister while shirtless in a cage fight with her...despite him being the \"Master of Kung Fu,\" only then to \"saving the universe\" in the third act...all in his first film...while also confronting his feelings and emotional issues with his father. He learns how to use the Ten Rings in a matter of minutes without any learning curve, which is ridiculous, and duels an evil dragon with his own good dragon. The rings aren\\'t even the Mandarin\\'s rings from the comics, but rather ten mystical bracelets. The supporting cast is forgettable, and the jokes are dryer than cracker-juice. Even Michelle Yeoh\\'s star power is wasted and forgotten--most people don\\'t even know she\\'s in this film, which is a shame as she has helped pave the way for these lead and supporting actors and actresses in the film. The supporting actress Awkwafina feels outdated already, even though she just seems to be breaking onto the film scene as \"Marvel\\'s Katy.\" There is very bad chemistry between Shang-Chi and Marvel\\'s Katy...what could\\'ve been a romance with a different, more competent actor/actress pairing and writer was more of the \"friend-zone\" at best. You definitely don\\'t root for these two to fall in love and wonder if they even would. No chemistry, no tension...fully neutered...or possibly closeted (for now) to pander to a Chinese audience whose government wouldn\\'t show the film in spite of pandering to them. Finally, Shang-Chi\\'s sister is the real master of Kung Fu because she managed to become a better fighter than him, start an entire fight club in another country, all by watching him train and fight with Kung Fu masters while the patriarchy in her culture prevented her from studying martial arts with her brother.

And what a great idea for a superhero movie to tackle such a deep and relatable topic.There is even an important line of foreshadowing by Shang, the evening before the final battle: -I'm going to kill my father-. What a strong statement and what a setup.But then the climax of the movie turns out the be a fight between 2 dragons.. the father dies by pure bad luck couple of scenes earlier.. killed by a random monster.A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITYIf they had kept the emotional conflict and the father&son dynamic as the climax of the movie, it COULD have become a masterpiece, which would have been more then just a great super-hero movie, it would have become timeless.HERE'S MY PITCH FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES:1) the father tries to open the gate.

He asks for forgiveness. They exchange a few deep words before Shang rushes off.4) with the help of the rings and the village dragon Shang-Chi manages to defeat the Monster.5) The gate is still open and it needs to be closed.

Just before getting there his father pushes him out of the way and closes the gate in his stead. He dies saving his son and everyone else and redeems himself and ultimately heals the broken bond he had with his son....aaaaand scene.Now THAT in my eyes would be a worthy arc for the father and emotional climax which pays off the great build up the movie does.\",\n",

Basically, thousands of years ago, Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) discovered ten mystical iron rings, granting its user immortality and other great powers. He establishes the Ten Rings organisation and throughout history conquers kingdoms and topples governments. In 1996, wanting to expand his power, Wenwu goes in search for Ta Lo, a mystical heavenly realm inhabited by Chinese mythological creatures. He travels through a magical forest to the Ta Lo village entrance but is stopped by guardian Ying Li (Fala Chen). The two fall in love, but Li leaves with Wenwu when he is rejected by the villagers. Wenwu abandons the Ten Rings, and they have two children, Shang-Chi and Xialing. When Shang-Chi is seven years old (Jayden Zhang), Li is murdered by Wenwu\\'s enemies, the Iron Gang. Wenwu once again wields the rings to massacre the Iron Gang, resumes leadership of his organisation, and has Shang-Chi go through brutal training in martial arts. Xialing from childhood (Elodie Fong) secretly copies this training. When Shang-Chi is fourteen (Arnold Sun), Wenwu sends him to assassinate the leader of the Iron Gang. But Shang-Chi is demoralised after fulfilling his mission and decides to run away to America, settling in San Francisco and changing his name to \"Shaun\". In the present day, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) works as a valet with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina), who knows nothing about his past. They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings, led by high-ranking agent Razor Fist (Florian \"Big Nasty\" Munteanu) who steal a pendant that Shang-Chi was given by his mother. Wenwu anonymously provides Shang-Chi with the location of his sister and, fearing that the Ten Rings will go after Xialing\\'s matching pendant from their mother, Shang-Chi decides to meet her. He reveals his past to Katy, who insists on helping him. They find Xialing (Meng\\'er Zhang) at an underground fight club in Macau, which she founded after escaping from Wenwu. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant. They are taken to the Ten Rings\\' compound, where Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a magical map leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling to him and believes she is alive and being held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village unless they release her. When Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy object, Wenwu imprisons them. Also incarcerated is former actor Trevor Slattery (Sir Ben Kingsley), whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu, as The Mandarin, and his hundun companion Morris, who offers to guide them to Ta Lo. The group escapes and travel to Ta Lo, which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures. They meet Ying Nan (Michelle Yeoh), Li\\'s sister, who explains the history of Ta Lo: thousands of years ago, the village was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and its minions but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller\\'s world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been influencing Wenwu to believe Li is still alive so that he will open the Gate. Shang-Chi, Xialing, and Katy join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu\\'s arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales. Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi and forces him into the nearby lake, then destroys the Gate with the rings. Some of Dweller\\'s minions escape, and the villagers join forces with the Ten Rings to fight them. Shang-Chi is revived by the Great Protector, which leaves the lake to battle the minions. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more, with Shang-Chi gaining the upper hand, but he chooses to spare his father. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves his son, bequeathing him the rings before being killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness. The Dweller-in-Darkness is eventually killed by the combined efforts of Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing, and Katy. Following the battle, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San Francisco where they are summoned by the sorcerer Wong (Benedict Wong) to the Sanctum Sanctorum. In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson). They discover that the ten rings are emitting a mysterious signal. In a post-credits scene, Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings after telling Shang-Chi that she was going to disband the organisation. Also starring Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon, Tsai Chin as Waipo, Yuen Wah as Master Guang Bo, Jodi Long as Mrs. Chen, Dallas Liu as Ruihua, Paul He as Chancellor Hui and Tsai Chin as Katy\\'s grandmother, with the voice of Tim Roth as Abomination. Liu is suited nicely as the lead hero, Awkwafina is loveable as the hero\\'s high-spirited best friend, Leung is interesting as the half-hero half-villain father, and there is good support from the likes of Yeoh and Kingsley. It is a simple story of a young man who must confront his past and use his mastery in weaponry-based Kung Fu to save the world, the highlights are the fight on the speeding bus and the final epic battle featuring dragons and mythical monsters, I agree the excellent special effects may swamp a lot of what is going on, but a well-written script, many fast-paces sequences, moments of humour, and nods to past martial arts movies help to smooth things out, all together it is an entertaining superhero fantasy action. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Good!',\n",

At least actors like John Cho plays roles that puts an even footing with their other counter parts. This movie is more of a marvel's attempt to please the Chinese market for profit. Best way to describe this movie is it's 90's nickelodeon kid show acting combined with Tokyo drift level of Asian stereotype.

In the beginning of marvel women (in my opinion) were displayed as either a strong power woman or a sex object. Here the women are just themselfs. The storyline is something new for me, I never heard about these stories and legends before. But now I plan to do that way more often. It was a little disappointing that all the 'good' main characters survived without a scratch. Of course I am happy that they will return in these movies in the future, but it makes it less dramatic and realistic.

We then meet Li (Chen), who turns out to be the mum of Shang-Chi (Liu) & Xialing (Zhang).How the mystical realm of Ta Lo fits in and it's secrets aren't revealed until the third act, and after the intro, the film does well to show Shang-Chi & Katy (Awkwafina) living their somewhat unfulfilled lives in San Francisco, before the action starts to heat up when Shang-Chi goes looking for his sister. All the actors are very likeable, especially Leung, who does a great job of making sure Wenwu doesn't descend into a caricature of a bad guy, but truly feels like a misguided father. Some great cameos also round everything out and it's always great to see Michelle Yeoh.While a bit slow in some parts, the martial arts scenes and action near the end are great, without being overwhelming - certainly up there with 'Hero' & 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.

For example, during the insane bus fight scene, wouldn't you say that the Razor Fist (Florian Munteanu) was trying to kill Shaun (Simu Liu, before he was revealed as Shang-Chi)? That's what it looked like to me, but later it turned out that he was a strong arm for Shang-Chi's dad, Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). Wouldn't Wenwu be just a little PO'ed if the Razor guy actually hurt his son?Then there's the question of Shang-Chi's martial arts ability. After dispatching how many dozen fighters on the bus and on the scaffold, he gets blown out by his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) at the Golden Daggers Club. How? Similarly, Auntie Nan (Michelle Yeoh) doesn't have much trouble showing him what's what with her more elegant, flowing martial arts style. It seemed like Shang-Chi's ability got progressively worse as time went by, until the finale required him to rise to the occasion. And I can't for the life of me figure out why film makers can't make sure characters who use a bow and arrow get it right with the grip. When Katy (Awkwafina) takes up her archery practice, she squeezes the nock of the arrow between her fingertips, which is almost impossible with a high tension bow. The proper method calls for placing the nock between the index and middle finger on the bowstring. It allows for more accuracy, and you don't wind up with the arrow swinging up and down on the bow as you're trying to release it.Well, I guess that's enough ranting. The CGI special effects were quite astounding, I especially liked the colorful mythical creatures of Ta Lo. The martial arts sequences were exceptionally well choreographed as well, even though we know what's seen on screen is impossible in real life. The story itself was very much a rehash of hundreds of martial art film plots, which almost always seek vengeance for the death of a father, mother, mentor, master, take your pick. Even with that, it's an entertaining picture to watch, as the Ten Rings concept is given time to play out here, and in the expected sequel as well. As for that, the very final after, after, after credits scene appears to position Xu Xialing as the replacement for her father Wenwu at the head of the Ten Rings organization. We'll have to wait and see how Shang-Chi manages to deal with that whole scenario.\",\n",

Awkwafina does well to not be quite as annoying as she's been in other parts, but is given WAY too much credit and screen time considering she's just Shang Chi's buddy and has no actual skill or reason to be there. Especially with how's she's treated by Wong later in the movie. Why Marvel needs her to be included quite as much I've no idea. Especially considering how great Shang Chi and his sister were in the film.Lastly, the fight choreography. It is VERY good. An absolute tribute to the late Brad Allan and was a joy to watch.

The first action set piece is terrific, original gripping and really well done.And all in all, it does succeed by being a little bit different to what has come before.There is an entertaining surprise as well. Which succeeds in doing some good continuity.Minor quibbles: it's ten minutes too long. My attention did wander during some of the quieter moments and scenes of people talking. One flashback is a bit extraneous. The character of his sister ends up being rather underused.And outside of the first set piece I mentioned, they forgot to put any other bits of jeopardy in here.

The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting.

Not unexpectedly, they resorted to the tired tropes of king fu/martial arts and Eastern mysticism as if that is all Chinese culture is about. Unlike Black Panther, where they envisioned a futuristic African kingdom, Shang Chi would not be out of place in 15th-century China. It is exasperatingly unimaginative and reductive. If they were to apply the same treatment to the white heroes of the Marvel universe, we would be watching either a Western or a bunch of heroes/villains who are supremely adept at colonizing new territories, subjugating their local populace and stealing their wealth.

This is a gorgeous film to watch. The effects are, as expected, first rate.The script is good, with much more laughter than I expected.

The dialogue feels wooden most of the time, just really unnatural and don\\'t even get me started on the \"humor\" which is overly forced and just really bad.It feels like a movie that knows what it wants to do, but not how it wants to do that and just goes at it in a dozen ways leaving to much clutter and sidesteps for it to feel like a coherent story. If only they had chosen 1 or 2 things and stuck with them it could have been a decent flick.',\n",
              " 'Overall, the movie was worth a watch. A lot of pretty scenery and great fight scenes. It is just getting ridiculous how the directors and production companies are not caring about the movie quality anymore, as long as they get their messages out. You can tell the director and writer have never picked up a Marvel Comic. They way they try to make you see that this movie is tied into the Marvel Universe is ludicrous. I see the writers all sitting around someone who got themselves in the group because daddy works at a higher level. No experience whatsoever.\"Let\\'s see, I have an idea. Ok hear me out. Wong, Wong is Asian so lets make sure he makes an appearance. That makes great sense to me. Now what reason would Wong have to fight in a place you wouldn\\'t find anyone as honorable as he is, to be hanging out. Ok, let\\'s don\\'t explain that people will just get it because he is Asian, right? Ok now who would he fight in the \"Look here I am to connect this movie to us\" scene? Oh, I got it. Abomination. Ya that makes total sense to me. I mean, Wong was just minding his business one day, and Abomination stopped by because he was in the area and wanted to know if he wanted to go fishing. Wong said sure, let me open up a portal to the lake and we will go. Oh, my. My portal got messed up. How did we get to an illegal fight club in China? Ok, I guess while we are here, we will sign up to fight each other, since I just forgot how to open my portals. (Oh No!) Fight, Fight, Fight. Ok Abomination I am going to make you punch yourself. Hands through the portal, my favorite trick. Works all of the time. Ouch, Wong. That hurt. Oh but guess what Abomination. When you took that hit, it woke me up to remember how to open my portals again. Let\\'s go home, shall we. Ok Wong, let\\'s go.That is it. It would rival the greats. I am a genius.No you are an idiot. Actually, you may just have bad taste. The hiring people at Marvel are idiots and the people that give final approval, are no better.Well, we had a good first round of Marvel movies for 20 years. The millennium generation is taking over, so it is all downhill from here. Dang.',\n",

              " 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining albeit formulaic popcorn Marvel film that\\'s part-family drama and part-kung fu adventure that is raised by Tony Leung\\'s villainous performance as Wenwu. It delivers a solid introduction to an Asian American superhero while paying tribute to Chinese martial arts films.First off, it\\'s very pleasing to see the warm reception Shang-Chi has received across the world. It\\'s a phenomenon to see English-speaking audiences intensely cheering for a subtitled film that has large portions in Mandarin. Back in my university days, the average Western filmgoer typically would not see a foreign subtitled movie on the account of not wanting \"to read a movie.\" Look at how much the world has changed now.The first half of Shang-Chi plays much stronger. The San Francisco bus sequence is reminiscent of a Hollywood big-budgeted version of 90\\'s Jackie Chan films set in Western locales, like Rumble in the Bronx, Who Am I or First Strike.The fight choreography moves from hard fisticuffs towards fantastical wuxia, and plunges into more and more CGI. The former is more engaging with Shang-Chi being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time in a real setting.Simu Liu does a solid job as Shang-Chi and has impressive moves. Like an athlete, he sells the hits and moves swiftly when performing parkour. Liu grew on me throughout the movie, much to the aid of the always-charismatic Awkwafina as his best friend Katy. They share a charming banter as if they were doubling as their own R2-D2 and C-3PO.The film\\'s MVP is Tony Leung, who approaches his role with an award-worthy intensity, injecting a depth and gravitas to his villain that elevates the film to another level.I was amazed by the depth Leung achieved through his scenes. The scene that struck me was a flashback where Tony Leung\\'s Wenwu comes home through his door and gives a look of concern to his own family. In that one glance, Leung portrays a completely different person in contrast to the villain in the present. His performance cut right through me and I felt I was watching someone suffer.It is unfortunate as Wenwu is undercut by the script introducing a second villain late in the second half, which diminishes Leung\\'s character. Wenwu is established as an immortal who\\'s fought for power through the ages, yet there\\'s a lack of wisdom in his latter actions that felt unconvincing.Shang-Chi\\'s third act takes a strange turn into mythic realms and loses the gravitas that was promised in the first act. The story shifts into a westerner\\'s stereotypical view of China. We get the straw hats, the rice paddy village that looks Cambodian, and the constant mention of dragons. With a CGI-infused finale spectacle, the movie then exhausts all the good will earned from the first half.Shang-Chi is entertaining Marvel fare that will be remembered best as a cultural zeitgeist icon for Asian American representation. However, as a film, I don\\'t feel the need to revisit it anytime soon. When I will, it will be for the San Francisco section and Tony Leung scenes.I am Asian, not Asian American. I\\'m happy for other Asian Americans who feel represented by Shang-Chi. I personally do not feel that representation from this film and am fine with that. Looking at the film itself, I admit Shang-Chi is one great step in the Asian American representation fight. However, it\\'s apparent there\\'s still a heck of a long way to go...',\n",

I could not even finish the last 20 minutes of the movie it was so bad. They introduced horrible actors with horrible dialog that just made the movie dumb and worthless.I gave this movie 2 stars only because of the first 10 minutes were ok.I'd really like to get at the root of the problem of the recent bad movie epidemic coming out of hollywood that's been going on for about the last 5 years. WHAT GIVES!?\",\n",

If you had watched the trailer, from the 1st moments of the movie, you'll know exactly what will happen and in what order. At that point, Marvel usually throws in a few surprises. Not in this one. Everything goes smoothly from an action fantasy children movie.Acting is great. Everyone plays their roles to perfection. There's nothing to complain here.CGI is, like I said earlier, more Disney than Marvel. Remember the Lion King remake where it didn't feel right. It's the same here. Looks gorgeous at first sight but fails to connect emotionally.In Summary, there are entertaining moments, but the writers room clearly saved the good stuff for future movies. This one is just a filler to introduce a late character.\",\n",

It didn't feel like a marvel film, I'm not against diversity or going in different directions but it just wasn't a film I loved or would see again. The characters were bland and uninspiring, the humour was ok but bit same old same old and the plot which I'd guess you'd call the main theme felt a bit daft.The cgi was awesome, graphics, choreography and costumes all really nice, parts were genuinely beautiful but if the film ain't doing much for me that doesn't matter.Think a lot would hinge on whether you got this gimmick or liked it, I didn't, they were cool for set pieces and what they wanted to achieve in the movie but I just felt they weren't something I thought was interesting or that impressive.It was always going one way, it was pretty predictable and I didn't feel or believe the emotion as I found the story a bit stupid, it just felt directionless and they were trying to do so much whilst achieving very little.It felt long to, much longer than the run time, it just wasn't a film I'd recommend and it was one I felt disappointed.I maybe backwards though as everyone's saying this makes up for black widow, I don't get that, I thought black widow was brilliant. Way better than this.Also it seems if it's Asian and a bit funny everyone calls awkwafina.\",\n",

But I was not disappointed.Straight off and you get a cultured vibe honouring Asian film and tradition and you get superb action and charismatic characters all well delivered by a strong cast.Reminding me of Jackie Chan in his heyday, the martial arts is fast and creative. Shang-chi feels really grounded and fresh for the first half of the film and it's good to move away from too much wild. But then the second half blends Asian folklore and Marvel fantasy to truly deliver a spectacle. Without having to explain itself too deeply the consistent nods to Dr Strange remind you that other dimensions exist and people can bend powers in believable ways.Whilst it may not have needed to go so far onto fantasy, any true Marvel fan knows this is just another tuesday. The performances are strongly delivered and Shang-Chi is likely to become a new fan favourite.\",\n",

Too far fetched for me to enjoy and I just didn't enjoy the story.The headless creature and scouse guy were interesting additions. It is watchable if you're not expecting much.Overall, I wouldn't recommend unless you love extremely far fetched non fiction superhero movies.\",\n",

There are atleast 3 better origin stories existing. But there's a lot of good things Shang-Chi does that differentiates this film from the normal MCU film. The Visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any MCU film I have seen. The tone of the film resembles Chinese Action Movies more rather than MCU which is so refreshing. The first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a CGI Monsterfest. The story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition. At its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and I craved for that in so many scenes. The performances are solid with Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley providing great Comedic Relief, but the standout is Tony Leung. He generates such level of empathy and emotional suffering with just his eyes, He is the Legend after all. Overall its a really fun watch, but not as great as people are shouting it is.\",\n",
              " \"Shang-Chi has a promising start with stunning locations with a nice martial-arts-movie feel. The fights were nice. Of course we have some good cracks along the way. Later on, we get into the main story line and that's where it starts to fall off. The jokes start to make you wonder why they are kind of forced into the picture because some of them are very lame. Comedy worked good in Thor: Ragnarok, I really loved them. But here its just bad. That's all.The main problem with the story is that *spoilers alert* Shang Chi and the villagers could have easily made his father understand about the whole soul-eaters thing. That guy seems to have lived more than 1000 years and wouldn't he understand about the whole talking to the mind thing?One last annoying thing is that why the hell they are having two post credits scene as if they were any good. The last one never needed to be in the post credits at all. That's just a normal scene which could have been shown before the credits.Shang-Chi would may be entertaining for those who are new to the whole superhero movies. For others, it may seem very formulaic, doing the same thing with different (weak) stories.\",\n",

They were mildly reminiscent of the Matrix fights( The intro to the Shangchi theme music even sounded suspiciously similar to Furious Angels from Matrix Reloaded and made me miss the Matrix films more)However, anything positive about the film ends in the first half only with the second half culminating in a bloated CGI mess that is the hallmark of almost all Marvel movies. In fact, between Shangchi and Black Widow, I'd say the latter featured much better visual effects which would have looked better on the big screen than this. Shangchi would have been a more apt as a direct to video release.)It didn't also help that the lead actor was a complete void of charisma.Honestly, I am just going to watch some Jackie Chan movies now to now to help deal with the kung fu cravings this movie initiated in me but failed to deliver.\",\n",

They were clearly going for the teen demographic with this movie.I personally couldnt enjoy it. Marvel in general, hasnt really produced a film that I enjoyed in a very long time so its not really surprising.

              " '6 for purely martial arts entertainment.There are dozens of China-produced/financed martial arts/fantasy films where Laws of Physics-agnostic fight scenes are as implausible as the speeded up movements. However, most are either based on some ancient fable or setting, or in a police/crime drama where Chinese cities appear more modern than anything in North America.Probably also financed by China-based interests, this is a Disneyfied take on the bread-and-butter of Chinese martial arts films. The plot to draw in US audiences is to have the two young protagonists played by 1st generation N. Americans, including the off-the-wall Akwafina with her mouthy repartees and gravely vocal delivery.Apart from that, it is not particularly distinctive, with the major \"star\" casting of Michelle Yeoh who is well-known to US audiences for decades, first as a Bond \"girl\", then in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Star Trek Discovery series, and in Filthy Rich Asians. As a Malaysian, she is illiterate in any Chinese language, and learns her lines phonetically!The lead, an unknown Canadian, is competent and Awkwafina does her part to make the film \"relatable\" to the social media generation. Good CGI and opulent sets don\\'t compensate for an otherwise \"run of the mill\" martial arts production.------------------5/10 Social significance for US audiences.As for social comment, it is high time that entertainment media fully represent the demographic reality of the US, where 6 percent of Americans are of Asian origin, but both actors and storylines are almost invisible, only as secondary characters to a White or Jewish protagonist if they are Asian-American, or only able to seek pigeonholing roles of an immigrant, shopkeeper, criminal gangster, or taciturn Eastern guru - all of whom speak English with a demented cookie voice.This movie does nothing to address the basic lack of visible integration of Asian Americans into the fabric of portrayals of TV or film. I can think only of 911, and of the former reboot of Charlie\\'s Angels where the Asian origin of characters was neither highlighted nor subjugated.Apart from that, the multiplication of Mono-ethnocentric productions (on \"Black\" cable networks) still does not address the lack of portrayal of non-Whites in an integrated fashion - but a form of Apartheid in mass media.',\n",

Like Black Panther was to a lot of African-American audiences, Shang-Chi will ignite a spark in the hearts of Asians. This film opens the door to a relatable character and I love Simu-Liu's portrayal of Shang-Chi. I have watched Simu previously in the show Kim's Convenience as a comedic character and there couldn't have been better casting for Shang-Chi. Simu reflects the combination of an Asian-American character superbly and has an amazing screen presence. His character reminded me of Captain America because of his leadership role in the film, standing up against all odds, and overall amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. Awkwafina's character, Katie, was an amazing character, filled with comedic relief that gave a lighter tone, to a film that was a little bit too dark for a Marvel film. Tony Leung's character, The Mandarin stole the show with a vengeance. Tony Leung is absolutely ground-breaking in every role he plays and The Mandarin was a unique role he took on. Leung had an amazing screen presence and was my character in the film. The visual effects in the film were unique and I could see that the animators had taken inspiration from traditional Chinese films regarding Martial Arts, also having similarities in design to Doctor Strange. The action in this film was mind-blowing like I was expecting, and I loved the fight on the bus. The soundtrack was average, with the usage of traditional Chinese instruments. The songs used in the film were composed by primarily Chinese Hip-Hop artists and I enjoyed them. The writing in this film was good, but not great. One of the criticisms I have about the film is that the plot did not feel original and could've been executed far better. There were a lot of parts in the middle of the film that stole away from the central plot of the film. This film had a more emphasis on magic and fantasy as suppose Kung Fu. Overall, this film is hands down one of the best gems Marvel has produced, and I cannot wait for Shang-Chi to integrate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe further.\",\n",
              " 'Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You\\'re watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it\\'s worth it.WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as I walked to the car. It\\'s been a while since I walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like Civil War and Winter Soldier. And for the most part, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).The fight scenes in this movie.... how do I describe it... amazing martial arts that\\'s fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 5 seconds like I\\'ve noticed in the MCU.This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it\\'s not even close. It has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix\\'s Daredevil as some of the best we\\'ve seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that I was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. They\\'re all amazing.Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. The villain has full depth with clear motivations you can sympathize with. Cool, charismatic, intimidating, and formidable. Everything you want in a villain.Another area of improvement is the musical scores. Most of them don\\'t stand out. I think they learned. They\\'re on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. And now this. Not only is it a great score, it fits perfectly in the movie and the individual scenes/moments. It\\'s not as amazing as the Loki score but it definitely elevated the movie. It feels unique to this new franchise.Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it\\'s told. Flashbacks can slow down a movie, but here they are some of the best scenes.I loved all the characters, I loved all the casting choices, I loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn\\'t anything that didn\\'t work for me. It fires on all cylinders.Lmao I didn\\'t mention the cinematography. Why would I wait this long? It\\'s MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It\\'s candy for your eyes.It\\'s also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters. It feels organic. As opposed to the \"insert joke here\" method we\\'ve been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.What\\'s the opposite of formulaic? That\\'s this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that I didn\\'t watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn\\'t feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it\\'s own unique tone and feel and character.Continuing what I said in my headline, I have this thing where I get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. I don\\'t know why it happens, don\\'t know if it happens to other people. Maybe it\\'s partly because I can\\'t risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like, \"this is the coolest thing I\\'ve ever seen in my life.\" Hyperbole, but mannnnn.After Endgame (basically) finished phase 3, I was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But I wasn\\'t sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew I would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But I wasn\\'t expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow.All in all, I adore this movie. You may wonder why I wouldn\\'t give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and I watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, Inception, Mad Max Fury Road, etc. Movies that shouldn\\'t even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. The only superhero movies I\\'ve given 10s are The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises and Civil War.If you\\'re still reading, wow you\\'re awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.I\\'m still in such a good mood. I can\\'t wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but I might not be able to! (4 viewings, opening Thursday 9/2/2021, 9/5/2021, 9/22/2021, 3/26/2022)',\n",
              " 'It\\'s good, but not great.Disney was trying to market this as an Asian American flick made by and for Asian Americans. Which really never bodes well. When a movie caters to a specific race like this it\\'s usually produced not directed. It usually just uses cheap race pointed gimmicks and tropes. But the reviews for this movie have been really good. So I didn\\'t quite know what to expect. After Endgame and Black Widow and I really thought Marvel had lost it. Black Panther was just okay. This surpasses all the 3 movies and returns Marvel to a greater level again. It does remind me of Captain Marvel, not nearly as good, but similar quality and structure to it with similar problems.We have a male lead, Shang. A dry actor who lacks the charisma needed for the role, but he is just fine. Then he has a female friend who is the star of the show when she is on screen with him. She is just funny and cute. Her humor is a bit forced and weird here, but she knows humor and makes it work. There are some scenes where it\\'s too much though. Shang then has a sister who yet again is more charming than him, but not by much. She has that extra bit of charisma with a cool hair style while Shang is a handsome, happy, satisfied young person. There is no personal suffering or emotions behind his eyes. He acts out scenes and moves on. It\\'s not a deep character like Batman. Rather this is the old comic book Superman. Just a force with no pain. He beats up people and moves on.The dad is amazing! He basically makes the movie. He totally steals his scenes and his acting is spotless. You really have to see him to understand just what he delivers on screen as the antagonist. Even the Romanian with one hand is way better on screen than the protagonist. Basically everyone else has more charisma than the lead.The main issue here is the lack of clear plot focus of a good guy fighting evil. The dad tries to rescue an evil force he thinks is his dead wife. So he sends assassins after his son to get an amulet from him and to call him back. Same with his daughter. So the first hour of the movie is just fight after fight where the protagonist barely survives until we learn that the assassins are actually just there to greet them. So all of that was for nothing? Yep, no one was supposed to die. The dad just wanted to contact his kids. So where is the bad guy even?The fights are cool enough, but we don\\'t understand why they happen and when we learn why they happened it\\'s a huge letdown. The choreography and CGI is good though. The Chinese mythology here is amazing. There are a lot of real myth animals and old Chinese art. They even speak Chinese for much of the movie which is extra great. It just works to make it feel rich and interesting. It\\'s all true to real myths and real national history. Things Communist China once tried to burn and destroy to replace it with a new system. So they are recreating a lost world and culture in CGI. Unfortunately the \"bad guy\" never appears. The dad is sorta, kinda bad at times. The son fights his dad without magic while the dad is using magic. Yet they are equally powerful. So it\\'s not clear what there is at stake? It\\'s clear that the good guys can beat up even magical beings with their skills alone. Once they get magical power and extra weapons it\\'s too easy. You don\\'t feel like it\\'s finally fair. You feel like it was already too easy and now it\\'s extremely easy. At one point the evil forces are released by the dad, but even that fight is very one-sided. It\\'s too many good guys and they are way too powerful. The dad is a powerful character, but he never really feels dangerous.This reminds me of Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel in Endgame. Or the modern Spiderman with a billion electronic tools to save his ass all the time. It\\'s just not fun to see a protagonist trained as a killer easily kill everyone. There is nothing at play, no one loses anything, nothing is really in any danger. You need a weak character fighting greater forces. A character who has an inner need to prove himself. The movie lacks thematic soul. While the mythology and Chinese art give it another type of artistic soul. It\\'s just not enough to really make it work. It needed both things. So while it totally rests on one element and works as a fun watch it still feels empty overall. I want to rewatch Captain Marvel. It\\'s at least fun and has some clear plot and deep characters even though Captain Marvel is never in danger of losing. Here there is less personality and fewer grounded characters as everything is magical. It\\'s a wish-fulfillment movie all the way. We don\\'t even see people getting hurt as all that is off screen. So characters are killed without us seeing the actual death. It\\'s all very, very tame to a level Marvel has never done before. A proper Disney movie. I totally would get it if some people wouldn\\'t like the movie. Same with Black Panther. It feels too simple and shallow. But this is 10 times better than Black Widow and other such huge duds. I still have no want to watch a sequel. Shang will just be even stronger... what\\'s the point? I don\\'t want to watch another Captain Marvel movie either as such unless they do something really creative. Or Black Panther. You need to tone down their powers. But this one is fully dead in the water as it just feels shallow all the way. At least we got the magical world, but I have already seen it. So I don\\'t want to see it again. I want to experience a plot and feel the struggle. Without a struggle there is nothing deeper to explore. But at least Marvel shows that they still care about CGI so there is always something to enjoy in these movies.',\n",

              " \"I was somewhat surprised that the ten rings came back. I knew that they existed, and had been villains in a past MCU film, but a part of me wasn't expecting to see them again, that is until I saw the title of this film. Mind you, a part of me suspected that the Ten Rings were more of an Iron Man villain, but in the end I'm certainly not all that much of a fan of comics books, and I have certainly never really managed to get into them. Sure, I have purchased a couple over the years, but honestly, they have never really impressed me, at least the superhero comics, which seem to pretty much dominate most comic book stores these days.The thing with Shang-Chi is that it comes across a lot of a well made Hong Kong action flick, which I suspect was the intention. It is in part Big Trouble in Little China (which is probably why a part of the film was set in San Francisco, but also probably because San Francisco has a pretty large Chinatown). In another sense this film was much better produced than the old Hong Kong films, and as such reminded me more of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I suspect that this was done on purpose, namely so that it simply doesn't become just another Superhero film, and in that regards Shang-Chi certainly does play quite well into that.So, the story centres around this guy who discovers ten rings, an item that gives him immense power, and also immortality. Thus he builds up and army called The Army of the Ten Rings, and pretty much conquers the world. However, he hears of another realm full of mythical animals and decides to go and find it, but gets into a fight with the guardian. During the fight they fall in love and have children, however she is killed, and after he trains up his son up as a warrior, he orders his son to kill the head of the Iron Gang, but his son refuses and flees to the United States to work at a fancy hotel.This is basically an origin story, but much of it has to do with him fighting his father, who is the true Mandarin (if you remember from Iron Man 3, there was this guy known as the Mandarin, but it was just an actor that was acting as a cover for somebody else, and it then turns out that that particular Mandarin wasn't the true one as well). As for the army of the ten rings, they appeared in Iron Man I, being the group that kidnapped Tony Stark to get him to build them some weapon systems, but other than being a terrorist organisation, they didn't play all that prominently in the films after that.I'm a little loath to simply say that this is just another superhero film, because as I previously mentioned, there is a lot of the kung-fu film feel to it as well. However, I guess the problem is that we are probably reaching the point where there is starting to be quite a bit of Superhero fatigue. Then again, there has been a number of films released this year that had been put on hold due to the pandemic. However, I did find that this film was still quite fun, and while it sort of runs alongside your typical Marvel script, there is enough in this film to actually make it somewhat different. It was okay, just not particularly great. Oh, I should mention that there were some nice lines in it nonetheless.\",\n",

I would prefer to see this as a 6 to 10 1-hour limited TV series to further develop the characters. As it is, the burden went to Tony Leung too much without even giving his character room to grow.

In Iron Man 3, they made a total joke of the Mandarin. A fine actor, Ben Kingsley, was wasted for a bad caricature of Mandarin.The Shang-Chi movie ruins the Mandarin again. Because this movie was made by left-wing liberals who preach political correctness. Because they wanted to avoid anything which might be offensive or racist. Let me ask you, what is racist about an Asian man wearing traditional Asian clothes? And what is racist about an Asian man with long hair and beard? Exactly, absolutely nothing. That's how the Mandarin looks like in the comicbooks. In this movie, he has short hair, Western everyday clothes, looking like a random regular guy (boring), totally different name. Also, in the comicbooks, each of his rings has its own power, that means ten different powers. In this movie, all rings have the same power, so not even that is done right. In conclusion, this Mandarin has nothing to do with the original.By the way, this movie ruins Shang-Chi, too. He gets god-like powers, he could defeat the mighty Thor. Why??? Shang-Chi is a tribute to Bruce Lee, he doesn't have superpowers, martial arts is his skill.

              " 'SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is being called \"the Asian BLACK PANTHER,\" and I think this is an inaccurate description for two reasons. First, Asian cultures have been explored in-depth by Hollywood since the 1970s at the latest, and in ways that sub-Saharan African cultures have not. But second, and more to the point, SHANG-CHI is really just a mashup of two Hollywood subgenres that have been around for quite some time: the \"ethnic discovery\" film and the \"stupid American tourist\" film.The \"ethnic discovery\" film is the more recent type and by far the more interesting, ultimately inspired by Alex Haley\\'s famous TV miniseries \"Roots.\" It documents the saga of a protagonist who learns - or relearns - about his or her heritage and embarks on a quest to fully embrace that heritage. A good example I can think of is THUNDERHEART, in which an FBI agent (Val Kilmer) comes to appreciate his father\\'s Native American ancestry while on a case on a Lakota reservation; a more famous but fantasy-based example is STAR WARS, in which Luke Skywalker learns that he has Jedi blood. On the surface, SHANG-CHI definitely follows this pattern.Unfortunately, the movie\\'s \"ethnic discovery\" theme is undercut by the clichés of an even older Hollywood storyline: what one film historian has dubbed the \"racial adventure film,\" but which I simply call the \"stupid American tourist film.\" Common since the 1930s, this film plot follows Western (and almost always white) characters as they visit an \"exotic\" foreign land - often for purely exploitative purposes - and proceed to reveal their ignorance about the \"native\" culture. It has always been demeaning to both the \"colonizing\" and indigenous peoples, since the former are forced to make buffoons of themselves and the latter must bear the humiliation of not being taken seriously.SHANG-CHI is an \"ethnic rediscovery\" film in that two Chinese-Americans from San Francisco learn (and, in one case, relearn) about the culture of their ancestors; but it is also a racial adventure film in that they are essentially Westerners who travel to China and find themselves in the midst of a culture clash. While not white - and, in the case of the titular character, an immigrant - Shang-Chi and his girlfriend otherwise fit the role of the \"stupid American tourist\" with their unmistakably American accents, annoying use of slang, pointless pop-culture references, and wisecracking sarcasm. The twist here is that, like Kilmer in THUNDERHEART, they revert to their \"noble savage\" origins once they have traveled to an \"ethnic\" place and \"gone native.\"Not incidentally, there\\'s one more way in which SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS differs dramatically from BLACK PANTHER. While both are based on \"non-Western\" comic book sagas created by white men, BLACK PANTHER turns stereotypes about black Africans completely inside-out, giving us fantastic science fiction instead of hackneyed \"jungle\" adventure. But SHANG-CHI is just the usual \"kung pow\" hash about the Orient, presented ironically but also in a way that isn\\'t terribly original.In fact, if there\\'s another Marvel movie this one closely resembles, it\\'s not BLACK PANTHER but DEADPOOL. Both combine wacky humor and serious (and even \"dark\") subject matter in a way that\\'s very jarring and ultimately exasperating. But at least DEADPOOL felt fresh.',\n",

I'm bored with fights on buses and trains and people leaping around scaffolding. Every Marvel movie has a fight scene on a bus or a train, but this one felt REALLY recycled.Getting back round to the characters, besides Shang Chi, I can't remember his sisters name, or his weird friends name, who served zero purpose in the movie, accept serving as a loud mouthed joke teller. It was almost as if they wanted a Kevin Hart like star, but had to settle with Awkwafina? And Shang's sister? Just added nothing to the story or the movie. She looked NOTHING like Shang either, or her younger self, the casting was well off there.Ben Kingsley showing up was amusing, but honestly that was it when it cames to laughs. You could see every joke coming up 30 seconds before it was delivered, because it was a recycled joke from other Marvel superhero movie.Wong and The Abomination make a cameo appearance in this movie, but their addition is given NO CONTEXT, and makes zero sense, and adds nothing to the movie or their own stories.Overall, I'd just say every character felt, just like a Chinese copy or a character you've already seen in a Marvel movie before. By the end, I felt like I had watched a propaganda movie made by the CCP.

              " 'Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.The storyline told in \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn\\'t really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.Visually then \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.The character gallery in \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.\"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.I was more than genuinely entertained by \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel\\'s hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.My rating of \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars.

              " 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a wonderful movie in so numerous ways... Visually striking, with a great mastery of the staging from beginning to end.So much visual poetry, the legend/adventure aspect of it is really top-notch, with legends & mystical elements that grab you ever more with the story unveiling before your eyes ... The humor is very pleasant (Katy, played by Awkwafina, brought a welcome energy & heart in each of her scenes) and adds a pretty pleasant flavor to the whole adventure.I really loved the way the characters are written, with Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) as a complex & layered figure all along the movie... And Xialing (Shang-Chi\\'s sister, played by Meng\\'er Zhang), as well as Li (their mother) are both highly enjoyable to see express themselves on-screen, they both have a lot of presence (and skills), each in their own ways.I found the entire movie very coherent, every detail makes sense and is counter balanced in a way or another... Yes, there is a strong notion of balance (darkness & light, and so on), with a lot of messages infused in both the action & dialogs. It is an extremely entertaining movie, but I really wanted to emphasize the richness and depth of its story/mythology and characters, all connected in the most organic way.By the way, I loved the whole Asian/Chinesz myths & legends aspec of the movie, the spirit & philosophy of it all was a true delight to my eyes, with countless Sci-Fi elements entwined in it, but all smoothly integrant of this mythology...\\nI think I probably put it in my Top 5 Marvel movies... I found the staging really majestic, from the dialog scenes to the action scenes, the humor, the flashbacks, and this new \"universe\" (mythology) that is presented here, it just all flows in such a delightful way from beginning to end.Marvel Studios always are very very clever at hiring a great variety of talents, and they nailed it once again... Destin Daniel Cretton (the director of the movie) is super creative and manages to construct pretty complex scenes while always masterfully telling a story, building a deeply cohesive piece ; it\\'s all fantasy but nonetheless feels visceral and real. This movie is another Marvel movie you often forget that it is a Marvel movie, precisely because of its powerful and so deeply captivating mythology, and this emotional weight that you can feel over the characters, it truly sets something different. It felt like I was watching a movie in the vein of certain epic Asian adventure/martial arts movies... Gotta admit it\\'s my jam, so... In addition to the Marvel stuff, it\\'s a very pleasant feeling.The energy in the movie theater was fun, lots of people were excited from all these scenes that just grab you. Because yes, clearly... There is a good number of mind-blowing scenes in this incredible movie ! The photography and color treatment make the movie very striking... And like I said, certain scenes mesmerize you because of their beauty & mastery, or even their grand epicness ! At times, it feels like an epic fresco that you are contemplating.The scene when/where the two parents meet for the first time is beyond gorgeous (the setting, the colors, the choreography, the costume design and overall design, the music & sound effects, the characters and the atmosphere as a whole) ; an absolute masterpiece of art, visually way beyond sublime, what a gift for the eyes, wow...

              " '\"The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange.\" Wenwu (Tony Leung)This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina\\'s Katy, Sean\\'s girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters\\' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.',\n",
              " \"First thing first is the cast in Shang-Chi is excellent. Every performance is great and the chemistry between Shang and Katie is excellent. I am so glad the movie did not create a forced love-interest plot between the two friends. A few of the action sequences are good and better than what we received in Black Widow. The bus fight scene in the first third of the movie in particular is a standout.45 minutes into the movie when Shang-Chi is reunited with his father I was bored beyond belief until the last act of the movie. The film switches gears and continuously dumps exposition on the audience. Everything from here becomes the predictable hero needs to accept his true self story we have seen a million times. Which is a shame because the first act of the movie seemed so fresh from what we typically get with MCU movies. The fight in the last act, while entertaining, are the typical CGI mess found in marvel movies. The one on one between Shang and his father was genuinely emotional, but once you add all the CGI dragons/monsters it becomes a mind-numbing bore.Another thing that bothers me is the character development. Excellent performances aside none of the characters go through any deep growth. The story plays out exactly how you would expect with training montages, green screen vistas and humor ruining any moments of tension. For example, Katie seems to be unnecessarily dragged into everything, learns archery in a few hours, survives a vicious battle and hits the monster right in the neck from who knows how far away. It makes my eyes roll into the back of my head thinking about it. The same thing can be said about Shang's sister. The heart wrenching conflict between her and Shang is quickly resolved and there is no character development for her. It's all nonsense and I need a little more substance with my flashy action.All my gripes aside I was entertained in spurts watching Shang-Chi because of the chemistry between it's stars and some decent action scenes. Which makes it all the more frustrating that is falls into the typical MCU formula after it's first act. Marvel take some freaking risks with your story-telling please!\",\n",
              " 'Shang-Chi is another bad and boring addition to Marvel\\'s weakest Phase in the MCU (Phase 4). It made less money at the worldwide box office than Godzilla versus Kong in the same \"pandemic era.\" The lead actor is boring in the film and pretentious outside the film...mocking fans, berating any constructive or genuine criticism, and spouting a bunch of foolishness on his social media that may get him canceled in the near future by one of the many angry Twittermobs. He basically is the male Brie Larson of the MCU. What could have been an action-packed, fun, exciting Kung Fu film in the MCU collapsed into a lame CGI-fest in the third act--think of the Dragon Ball Z or Avatar films that bombed at the box office. Once again, we had an overpaced origin story...watching Shang-Chi go from being an insecure valet, to getting kicked in the balls by his sister while shirtless in a cage fight with her...despite him being the \"Master of Kung Fu,\" only then to \"saving the universe\" in the third act...all in his first film...while also confronting his feelings and emotional issues with his father. He learns how to use the Ten Rings in a matter of minutes without any learning curve, which is ridiculous, and duels an evil dragon with his own good dragon. The rings aren\\'t even the Mandarin\\'s rings from the comics, but rather ten mystical bracelets. The supporting cast is forgettable, and the jokes are dryer than cracker-juice. Even Michelle Yeoh\\'s star power is wasted and forgotten--most people don\\'t even know she\\'s in this film, which is a shame as she has helped pave the way for these lead and supporting actors and actresses in the film. The supporting actress Awkwafina feels outdated already, even though she just seems to be breaking onto the film scene as \"Marvel\\'s Katy.\" There is very bad chemistry between Shang-Chi and Marvel\\'s Katy...what could\\'ve been a romance with a different, more competent actor/actress pairing and writer was more of the \"friend-zone\" at best. You definitely don\\'t root for these two to fall in love and wonder if they even would. No chemistry, no tension...fully neutered...or possibly closeted (for now) to pander to a Chinese audience whose government wouldn\\'t show the film in spite of pandering to them. Finally, Shang-Chi\\'s sister is the real master of Kung Fu because she managed to become a better fighter than him, start an entire fight club in another country, all by watching him train and fight with Kung Fu masters while the patriarchy in her culture prevented her from studying martial arts with her brother. She learned her fighting skills all on her own...in the shadows at night-time...welcome to the \"M-She-U\"...again...',\n",
              " 'For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019\\'s \"Captain Marvel\" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it\\'s ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he\\'s attacked on a bus, he\\'s forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.If \"Black Widow\" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it\\'s a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. \"Shang-Chi\" was that. It\\'s the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we\\'ve seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\"-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi\\'s parents. There\\'s some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong\\'s Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley\\'s \"Iron Man 3\" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU\\'s most divisive moments.It\\'s not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad.

That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I\\'d be very surprised if she didn\\'t, in future projects). He\\'s joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I\\'m told she\\'s in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won\\'t give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.Not quite, yet almost \"Black Panther for Asian audiences\", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I\\'ve already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don\\'t belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And \"don\\'t worry\", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren\\'t made out to be \"less than\".The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi\\'s Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it\\'s happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn\\'t enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.',\n",

I liked the marriage of martial arts and the Marvel universe until the action became a nonsensical mess. The visual effects that were Oscar nominated are pretty good I guess, but who cares?

Cultural mythical accuracy is sadly pushed aside by the writers and animators to retain a very standard plot. Characters' poor dialogues didnt help but the odd joke rarely did succeed. And I was very disappointed that there was a very poor attempt to capture the classical and contemporary Kung Fu element in the fights - it was limited and opportunity largely missed.

I know a lot of people wished they would have done much more with Mandarin as he is a pretty big bad in the comics and they hyped him up a lot.

              " 'For the Asian martial art genre, the evolution from kung-fu to wire-fu to CGI-fu is something to behold. \"Shang-Chi and the legend of the ten rings\" in fact has a bit of each. But then, it is much more than being just the latest addition to this genre. It is a re-assurance to fans that there is life after Avengers. It is one of the opening shots (another is Spiderman, and there are more coming) into the new Marvel Cinematic Universe. As well, it introduces more minority superheroes after Black Panther. There is indeed already one yellow, but Wong is only a sidekick to Dr. Strange. I used the word \"yellow\" not in any disrespectful way, but rather in the context that there is even a green among the major Avengers. Why not a yellow then, or two?The cast is solid. Carrying but not leading the movie are seasoned veterans Tony Leung (the entire movie) and Michelle Yeoh (the second half). Playing the protagonist, Simu Liu is surprisingly good, toggling effortlessly between poignancy and levity. Whatever role she plays, Awkwafina gives credibility to the character in a way that is a pleasure to behold. Meng\\'er Zhang is well cast. I think of LIU Yifei when Zhang\\'s character appeared. But Liu, arguably prettier (\"arguably\" because it\\'s all in the eye of the beholder), would not have the right mix of defiance and vulnerability that Zhang capably delivered. Fala Chen has a heavier role than I expected and handled it capably. Icing on the top of the cake, somewhat of cameo roles are Ben Kingsley, YUEN Wah (an iconic martial art actor to those who are familiar with this genre) and Benedict Wong. I thought Wong is just a cameo at the beginning but he has a pivotal role in the end-credit teaser, together with Brie Larson and Mark Ruffalo, introducing our two protagonists into the post-Avengers MCU.Deftly directed Hawaiian born Destin Daniel Cretton, the movie sets up the story in two VO sequences. The opening sequence, rich with visuals, is narrated by Li (Chen), telling the story of the rise of XU Wenwu (Leung) who acquired amazing power upon coming into possession of the magical ten rings (not small ones worn on fingers, but large ones worn on the forearms, five each). After conquering through space and time, Xu seeks the mysterious lands of Ta Lo, finds it, and finally gets beaten by someone endowed with Ta Lo magic. Still in the VO, Li reveals that this is herself, and adds, \"And that is where I met your father\". After some further, somewhat vague, information, we move on to present day.In San Francisco, Shaun (Liu) and buddy Katy (Awkwafina) work as happy-go-lucky parking lot valets who take patrons\\' vintage vehicles left in their care for joy rides occasionally. Well, maybe not just occasionally, we don\\'t know. The relationship between this pair, while warmly affectionate, seem platonic, at least at this point. Provoked to a maddening melee in a cable car, Shaun reveals an entirely different persona to Katy. Next thing you know, he has to go to Macau before his father Xu hurts his long lost-sister Xialing (Zhang). Katy won\\'t let him off the hook so easily. \"You can explain it on the plane\" she quips.So here comes the next VO sequence, again with rich visuals, in which Shaun explains to Katy that he is really Shang-chi, who, after mother\\'s death, ran away from despotic father, abandoning his little sister in the process.Next stage, Macau, where Shang-chi finds that Xialing, abandoned by him, has made it on her own, creator and owner of a plush fight club, and hating him for abandoning her. Next thing, Xu shows up, take the trio to his empire to join him in his scheme to find and burn down Ta Lo, to rescue his wife who he believes is not really dead but just held captive by her own people. The trio escapes, finds Ta Lo first to warn Shang-Chi\\'s aunt, Ying Nan (Yeoh), who is now in charge. From here on, it is building to the climactic clash.The story is told with ably crafted narrative, together with capable acting, beautiful cinematography, and good CGI.

The movie centres around the Ten Rings Organisation, which is lead by Shang-Chi's father, who is a man that has been consumed by power and greed for thousands of years. This movie received so much praise, with many claiming this is one of the best instalments in the MCU. However after seeing the film, I have to say I was extremely disappointed. Easily the worst aspect of the movie is the writing. Almost every plot point occurs for no reason but to simply give the audience a purposeless action sequence or provide an exposition dump. To give an example, Shang-Chi's father sends his men to fight his children and we don't have any idea why. The action is cool to look at, and after three lengthy sequences it turns out he just wants them to return to his organisation. We find this out because the father shows up after all the pointless fights, and they just willingly go with him. Couldn't he have just shown up at the start of the movie? Like that would have been way more efficient for him. Basically the entire movie follows this trend. Even the fact that he wants his kid's help makes no sense. He didn't actually need them. He has the ten rings and an entire army to fight with. Like I get he needed their pendants to reveal a confusing useless map for 3 seconds, but couldn't he have taken the necklaces then left them alone? All this is really unfortunate because the execution of some action sequences are so great. Like Shang-chi's fight with his sister. I love hand to hand combat. But there was no purpose behind the fight. It's like someone just put the scene in because the movie got boring. Unfortunately, the movie does not end on a high either. I sat there having to stare at awful green screen and so much CGI, I couldn't help but laugh at it. Overall I thought this movie was watchable but extremely disappointing. There was potential to make a great film here, but to me it felt like marvel did not care about the script.\",\n",

How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up.I think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation of Asian characters, especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. The film had a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time) The movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned.

And also fabulous, just like Warner\\'s neighbors, however, even those have a relatively gloomy fantasy world than a film about a mysterious terrorist organization known as \"Ten Rings\" - from which the Marvel Cinematic Universe began and what they fooled our heads about, if you like. , hinted in other films. The Marvelites should not lag behind anyone or anything, so it was necessary to burn down their magical world without blackjacks and strangers, but with a variety of creatures, including, his mother, dragons (not a mother, although we will see the mother of dragons). The mandarin or simply Xu Wenwu, thanks to the magic rings (and it is not known who he is to remove the rings) conquered the lands for centuries until he got tired of it. At the end of the last century, he began searching for a certain mysterious village, in which, according to legend, many mythical animals live. However, at the entrance he met love, with which he performed something like a dance, after which they got married and lived happily (this is not an Indian movie!). The worlds of \"Flying Daggers\" and \"Mood for Love\" converged - at this sweet moment it was possible to finish the film. But it was not there.The sweet story turned into children and a sudden death, after which Dad decided to raise a stern karate kid and a worthy successor, copying Oldboy in places. However, he grew up and merged into fashionable San Francisco, where he hung out with not the most pleasant girl performed by Aquafina. Marvel is too fond of keeping up with trends, and where necessary, socialist China will be represented by paradise, and women will rule the world, which is done so ostentatiously and unnaturally that it evokes the opposite feeling of tolerance. First, the most powerful person on earth is defeated in a battle with a villager, then a sister beats her brother, and another villager commands everyone, giving orders (well, we also watch the second scene after the credits, if we have enough patience). No one asks the conditional aunt Luda to stand at the stove all day, although if there were such a lady in the MCU, she would acquire an army or at least keep a barrel under an apron, but a sense of proportion is sometimes a necessary thing. And Aquafina, Shang-Chi\\'s girlfriend, is responsible for a simple girl, but her heroine infuriates more than all the others put together due to poor humor, which has already turned into a kind of Marvel style or even a cliche, when a serious and even tragic story needs something yes, dilute so that the kids do not get bored. But sitting on all the chairs at once is extremely difficult.Shang Chi, or in the world, Sean, as expected, has to return to his native land in order to confront the same notorious ghosts of the past. Of course, the irritable companion leaves everything and everyone, rushing after him. As expected, he finds himself in his mother\\'s native land, where a custom-made fashionable hero costume, as well as dance lessons, awaits him. And, of course, everything turns into another sterile mess (although the Russo brothers with a PG-13 rating did more interesting things), as if conveying ardent greetings to the Black Panther finale, and there are a bunch of other films. We\\'ve seen all of this a hundred times already, as well as the hero going crazy after losing his wife, and all these mythical creatures and serious fights would be appropriate if Marvel set the right tone. Alas and ah - everything turned into a continuous and familiar buffoonery, where there was even a place for Sir Ben Kingsley, who was again given to play a fool, because one fool is not enough for a film. Maybe the picture will delight the Chinese, and they will fall from laughter under the chairs of cinemas from so many clichés and cranberries, but they are probably already accustomed to this, and only openly yawn, they say, they have not seen this. And all this half-epic will again be trolled in the conditional \"Avengers 5\", although no - the Marvelites have already successfully done this by the end of the film, because the tragedy is not a tragedy, that the epic battle is ridiculous, but the brutal Thanos, meanwhile, is already completely obscene in the parallel running animated series \"What If ...\"\\nThe main problem of Marvel is an unsuccessful attempt to please everyone, and at the same time a careless attitude towards projects like Shang-Chi, which stand apart, that is, they are not particularly tied to the global plot of the MCU, even if they are referring to it with all their might. And the most offensive thing is that there was some potential, the idea could really turn into something more entertaining, but not in this MCU, probably. Such films often act as a kind of postcard and agenda supporting the brand\\'s status. And popular brands must adhere to certain frameworks and ideologies, which is self censorship, which is more harmful than the other way around. They shoot films every three or four times - the same \"Avengers\", in which there is a lot of action and a much more global plot, and special effects that are needed. After all, the audience always wants more, which is why all the bets on films like \"The Multiverse of Madness\" and \"No Way Home\" - the main thing is not to drain the good old villains there, or even, you see, Spiderman. But \"Shang-Chi\" respect only for the glorious \"Hotel California\".',\n",

              " \"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.\",\n",
              " \"This is the first Marvel film since 2012's The Avengers that I would call a big dud. The reasons for its failure are many; the reasons that it almost succeeds are exactly two: Nora Lum (Awkwafina) and Ben Kingsley. Aside from these two shining points of light, the film's an energetic flop.The main reason for the failure is the script. Now, I have been watching movies for five decades, and I can tell when a film is paying homage to another film, and when it's just ripping off the ideas of a better movie. This 'script' rips off a series of better movies, starting with Deadpool 2, then Fight Club, then Skyfall, then Avatar, and probably a bunch of other action films I never saw. Along the way, we are asked to accept a silly premise that these magic rings and the bad guy wearing them have existed for a thousand years. Nope. Just a dumb idea. One look at his gleaming and perfect thousand year old teeth and the whole thing falls apart. The film never recovers from that.Next, there is the spectacularly bad directorial choice (from the aptly named Destin Cretton) to have all the actors in the film display no emotions with their faces whatsoever. As mentioned above, the sole exceptions are Awkwafina and Kingsley. Every other actor, AND ESPEICALLY PRETTY-BOY LEAD SIMU LIU, seems to be a star graduate from the Kristin Stewart school of blank stares. Boo. Maybe Cretton was going for Inscrutable, but all we see is Constipated.The fight scenes are all generic karate video game stuff, boring at first glance, but unbearably dull after two hours. The music by Joel West is one blaring trumpet after another, so forgettable that I can't remember anything except constant boring noise.The production design is wonderful, as we expect from Marvel: sets dripping in vivid color, crisp and exciting visuals, wonderful costumes. There are many beautiful and talented Asian actors on display here, but the script is so awful that I felt embarrassed for them. As I said, Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley save this film from being a complete flop, and their two performances are so wonderful that I am almost willing to let the rest of the garbage slide.Almost.\",\n",

Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don\\'t know are also first rate.Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He\\'s a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than \"genial best friend of the main character.\" With all the other talent on screen he doesn\\'t manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don\\'t object to him.The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights.

Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Destin Daniel Cretton creates a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for the villain, Mandarin . Shang Chi is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking and one of the best action set pieces of this year which is the bus scene.\",\n",

It\\'s one of those marvel movies that, despite its defects, stands out from most superhero films, something almost impossible to do these days...Marvel has a reputation of creating great origin stories for its characters, at least establish the basics of them, orderly making the audience sympathize with them. Shang-Chi is no exception. It establishes the future role of this character and its importance on the MCU, but a deeper analysis into his past must be needed in order to make him go through the good ol\\' hero\\'s journey, something that the movie tried to accomplish, but was left incomplete while trying to prioritize some plot points.That\\'s another thing with this film: a sense of incompletion. It tries to set up so many aspects and characters that, it forgets to conclude anything :/. The final act doesn\\'t help either; having some of the most horrible looking CGI I\\'ve ever seen in a Marvel proyect and tiktok-worthy green screen effects.Maybe the character of Shang-Chi will leave me a better taste in my mouth as we see more of him in the future but, right now, it feels like a bumpy start to the introduction of a promising character.Also, the funny tones hit surprisingly well..... huh, who would\\'ve thought I would say that about a Marvel film....',\n",

Visually stunning, fantastic fight scenes, great story, and emotionally driven. Due to one too many lulls perhaps a slight bit too long in length, but overall, very enjoyable.When I was teen I loved watching Asian films such as \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", \"House of Flying Daggers\", & \"Ong-Bak\". This film had the great martial arts fighting sequences that the aforementioned films had. I felt like I was a kid again enjoying something fresh and new. I also fully enjoyed the combination of Mandarin (apologies if that\\'s wrong) and English. A movie with subtitles always reminds me that there\\'s more than the bubble of North American film.The acting was great. Michelle Yeoh was the one who stole the show for me at the end of the day. Again, it reminded of the good old days of martial arts movies that depended on the actors to make things believable instead of lots of CGI.I watch virtually zero Marvel movies and so if you\\'re iffy on whether to watch this or not it shouldn\\'t stop you from enjoying this film. It\\'s funny, action packed, and does not appear to be culturally inappropriate. The acting is great and the length of the film, while a little long, is still exceptional.PS... there are two after the credits scenes so make sure you have time sit until the very end.Enjoy the show!',\n",

This movie was very entertaining even if it had a pretty generic and predictable storyline, and special effects were fairly uneven (amazing 'MCU quality' along with pretty terrible early 2000s CGI). It's great to add more diversity with an Asian superhero but I hope they will make good use of him in future movies and not relegate him to secondary sidekick roles!\",\n",

I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.\",\n",

Had it been edited to a certain effect, one would not be able to discern it as a Marvel film.It's a background story of Shang-Chi obviously, but in a way, I felt like Tony Leung stole a bit of the show. It's his anguish that drives the film, as without it, there wouldn't be a conflict between him and Shang. Seeing Tony onscreen after so many years makes me want to go on a Tony Leung marathon, or at least watch Hard-Boiled again. He's always been so good at conveying emotion without words.Michelle Yeoh has small part in the film, but as always, she kicks ass and more or less plays the same exact role she played in the recent Gunpowder Milkshake as the older, wise Auntie.Simu Liu and Awkwafina have good chemistry in the film, but I actually felt like their characters otherwise were a little bit flat, as there was not much time spent on character development. Or at least in the character of Shang, alot of time devoted to flashbacks but little time spent with Simu in the present day, fleshing out his character. They seem like they would be fun people to hang out with? Awkwafina is vital to a plot moment, but otherwise, she has little presence other than a few small comedic moments but maybe that is enough.Morris is cute. I need to find that stuffed animal...The special effects are fun to watch and colorful.The plot is a bit simplistic, as it usually is with Marvel films. It's serviceable enough, but the film starts to fall apart during last 1/3-1/4 of the film when the fantastical elements show up and certain things happen that don't quite make any sense (or at least I haven't worked out why they should make sense). The fantasy elements don't quite work as well as just watching all the fight choreography from the earlier parts of the film, it's just not as interesting to me personally.All in all, a good time and a great prelude to a Labor Day weekend!\",\n",

If you are praising it for the Kung-Fu then better go and watch Chinese movies with a lot more Kung-Fu action and better story than this one.Here is my take with spoilers-1. They showed the main guy's father i.e The Mandalorian which was shown in Iron man 3(The fake one) is alive from thousand year and he is very brutal & has won hundreds of battles and blah blah blah...then how come a guy who has won so many battles doesn't even have a billion dollar even after thousand year.When he gets marry to the love of his life i am sure he wants to give her all the happiness but the guy is poor.Some local mafia people come to his house to take their money which he owes them but he wasn't at home that time and they kill his wife.I mean WTH is this?The director actually thought that a brutal, passionate king alive for thousand year with ten rings power can't even provide basic things to his family even after winning hundreds of battles.Who came with this plot?2. Our main guy i.e The hero of the story Shang chi is living the life of a valet. His father sends his people to get a locket from him which his mother gave him and his sister.Shang-chi and his father's goons fights off almost killing everyone in the bus and ruining at least a dozen cars but goons takes off the locket.Then hero goes to warn his sister and there also his father's goons fight off.After a long fight and almost 20-30 people dead his father comes in the scene and says he wanna take them home.I mean WTH again?If he wanted to take his kids home then why send his people to fight and let die so many people to get 2 lockets.Just speak to the kids and ask them to come home.3. They go home and his father plans to attack his wife's native place as he thinks she is alive and living there. Those 2 lockets shows the map of the village and the kids disagrees and father locks them.There they meet the fake Mandalorian from iron man 3(Ben Kinsley) & escapes with him as he has one of the animal from their mother's village who knows the map to the village.Oh man i am so tired of writing this.So by now u know they reach the village and even there father reaches there very easily and fight happens.Our hero gets the ten rings and saves everyone on a dragon.It really can't get worse than this.We all have seen so many action vfx movies by now that nothing amazes anymore.After watching marvel for more than 10 years we really don't deserve these underdog superhero stories.These are becoming so boringWe deserve better.I have no idea what people liked in this and why this movie has so high rating.\",\n",

I grew up loving \\'The Master of Kung Fu\\' because of the martial arts aspect and still have the original comic books. FYI: Shang_Chi was originally based-visually-on Bruce Lee. Paul Gulacy-one of the artist at the time-even drew Shang_Chi to look like Bruce Lee. They also made changes-mainly because of political correctness-to his origin story. Originally, Shang_Chi was the son of Fu Manchu, a racially insensitive character. But now, it has been changed to be the son of The Mandarin, an old Iron Man villain. In the comics, The Mandarin had 10 rings on his fingers but here it has been changed to rings on his forearms. These rings shoot energy force bolts and Tony also calls his evil organization, \\'The Ten Rings\\'. Simu plays Shang_Chi and Tony is the Mandarin. In this origin story, you learn what caused their estrangement and why Tony is wanting so badly to reconnect. Awkwafina plays Simu\\'s best friend that tags along on Simu\\'s adventures with glimpses into his past & present life-and lots of fantastic martial arts-and Michelle play\\'s Simu\\'s aunt.

The fights are so well choreographed but also fast paced and filmed to perfection. The bus fight is incredible!!!!!

First of all the pacing in like the 3/4rd of the film is a tat slow. The score honestly is weak. Might be my theater but there were moments where the score had to make me feel something and (credits to the movie itself that it let me ) i had to do that all by myself.The plot sometimes leans to a pretty basic plot, but because of the great screenplay it works.Cinematography was amazing. The acting was good. And the special effects were very good. One thing that I have to admit. Game of thrones kind of spoiled us with the design of .. a particular mythical creature so... that won't look as great as it could've been but still very good.But man the fights were incredible.. the camera work was so good.

It's certainly better than a few of the last installments (by a small margin), but this film is proof to all others that there really aren't any fresh ideas anymore, and the Marvel antics are getting rather boring.You have good guy who is lackluster in personality, has some family issues, turns out he's a very important guy in the world, has some impressive abilities which he hones, discovers things about himself, has someone close to him betray him, has to make some big decisions, engages in climactic fight, the end.These movies are so cookie-cutter, all Marvel is now, is predictable pomp and circumstance with flashy lights and SOME, not many, redeeming qualities. Let's start with those first:Choreography. There are some slick-nasty moves in most of the fight scenes. Action scenes, and entertaining fights is certainly one thing Marvel rarely disappoints.Humor. Another typical trait of a Marvel film, you get some good chuckles here and there. However without Awkwafina, this trait would be almost non-existent. And this is coming from someone who usually doesn't care for the smarky humor of the latest generations. But she is rather funny without being TOO annoying and sarcastic.Special effects and cinematography. Solid work, obviously they didn't downsize their SFX department. But compared to the bar set by previous movies in the Marvel world, it's not all that impressive.On to the unflattering traits:Story. WOOF. Predictable through and through, don't expect much of anything here. They could easily have held a writing competition at any average middle school for the students to write a basic action movie script, and the storyline for this film would have probably been the entry from the kid who won 3rd place.Characters. Aside from a a select few, the characters are as flat as a pancake in a hydraulic press.The humor and the action. While I mentioned this earlier as a pro, over time, it all got old towards the end. The attempts at humor starting falling short of the goal, and the action became stale.It's about time to wrap up this dynasty of Marvel movies and move onto something else before it starts to smell like discarded scraps of reused ideas, and accumulate maggots of banality.\",\n",

It's also way too Disney; that new, not so good kind.It's all pretty generic in the end, seemingly providing a sort fan service (or quite frankly pandering) to the Chinese audience more than anything else, by trying to cram as much Chinese mythology and history in it as possible. But also just as many stereotypes and clichés. It's all very shallow and it even went into shameless territory a couple of times, which is just weird.Acting is decent to good, but the woman playing Jar-Jar Binks, no I mean Legolas, no I mean Katy, got annoying real fast.With everything they had at their disposal to make a great movie, this sure could have been a whole lot better.6/10, barely.\",\n",

But in ancient China, when good things are documented, they were carved on stone monument and when bad things happened, they were documented in books.The essence about Yin-Yang, why Shang Chi's mom could easily handle his father's 10 rings Kong fu, was not presented clearly at all. It's a lot more than 'knowing who you are'.When I checked out writers, I think understood why. I guess at least there could have been a consultant who understood those part to help drafting the story details, because those are real gems from Asian culture and it was deep wisdom.But, these did not block me from enjoying the movie. It was a blast watching it, even for someone who grew up watching KongFu movie.\",\n",

Not a big issue though as the action part kicks in and makes up for it. Third act ten rings action visuals are pretty damn good and the water formation is breathtaking which reminded me of Raya.New guy \" Simu Liu \" owned the Shang chi role, as his efforts are clearly visible on the screen.

              " 'I\\'m super happy to say that Marvels newest movie outing, \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\", is a hilarious, action packed, CGI thrill ride and it\\'s a fantastic one at that. After seeing \"Black Widow\" I was worried that Marvel/Disney had started shifting their focus to their very ambitious TV mini series projects and left the quality of their movies behind. I\\'m now confident that isn\\'t the case. Here, sets, visuals, costumes, choreography, score, acting and directing are all top notch. Each shot feels fresh and visually stunning. Each joke and emotion land. And the action is amazing. The first big set piece involving Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and his best friend (awkwafina), is a bus ride to work gone horribly wrong, it hooks you instantly and has you either in awe with its incredible fight choreography or laughing at the perfectly timed jokes. It really doesn\\'t let up in either category going forward. I can\\'t believe how much I loved the pairing of these characters, their choice to not make it romantic and I love how different and real they feel from other characters in the MCU. Often Marvels problem has been their reliance on the same personality traits for their heroes, funny jerks with over confidence or bumbling idiots thrust into power. Here the main character is naturally a good person, hes comfortable with being himself and with his best friend, when power comes to him he accepts, he never truly stops being him, he doesn\\'t have to learn a lesson, he just rolls with the punches. Almost all of this goes to actor Simu Liu who brings an extra dose of likability to the role, along with the chemistry he shares with Awkwafina which makes their friendship believable. There\\'s even great references, cameos and credit scenes for the fans looking for that. Of course there are problems, the biggest is the big CGI slug fest ending that plagues these types of films, when all it truly needed to do was be smaller. It\\'s a mess of CGI at times and feels a little too big and too rushed. Characters just instantly know and understand things and accept everything with ease. It is easy to over look all this, with how much fun you\\'ll have.',\n",

I love the jokes between the two main characters and the banter they have together is great fun.

Adding a mystical and possible alien influence was in my view a mistake and not true to the character\\'s story. Nor the reimaging of The Mandarin, which I found to be disappointing. Aside from the tired storylines which have become common in these Marvel films, the ending was a little over the top. Aside from these criticisms, I\\'ll give kudos to a good cast and wonderful cinematography. If I ever get a faithful adaption of a Marvel comic I grew up with, I might be shocked.

Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.This movie however is not a failure.Why?This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of \"ah, too bad\" about him.This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.',\n",
              " 'I can tell you the reason to see this film is solely based on the performance of the incredible Hong Kong actor Tony Leung as Shang-Chi\\'s father Wenwu aka the real MANDARIN. He literally carried this film on his back. For those who aren\\'t film buffs, Tony Leung is basically Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington and Brad Pitt combined in Hong Kong. Even though Hollywood has knocked on his door a few times, finally, better late than never, he gets his due in Hollywood.Simu Liu throughout most of the film, I thought was alright, nothing too special, nothing too terrible. However, he has two incredible moments in the film where then I was completely sold on his character. A great display of acting, one of which involves a scene with Tony Leung where he calls out his failure as a parent. What I also admired is that Shang-Chi also has blood on his hands. He reveals this to Awkwafina\\'s Katy and Simu doesn\\'t overdo his performance in that scene. You felt his anger, his guilt and his remorse. This reveal reminded me he almost killed the Death Dealer, seeing and knowing this makes his character a bit more rich and complex. I appreciated that he wasn\\'t a saint.The relationship between Shang-Chi and his father Wenwu on the surface does involve superhero theatrics, however underneath it, it does have a very relatable dynamic. As an Asian myself, I think it will hit home to most Asians and their relationship with their parents.But despite all that, I did not love the film like I wanted to. It still falls under the same old formulaic humor I despise, mainly coming from Awkwafina. I will however concede that I did expect the humor to be a lot worse and thankfully it isn\\'t too unbearable. But if it were up to me, \"less is more.\" I had some inkling that Sir Ben Kingsley would show up and he does add the redundant humor into the mix.Although it works on some level, the story mainly lumbers along, obsessed with backstory. On the one hand I did feel the drag, but in the other I felt the flashbacks did help flesh out Wenwu, Shang-Chi and his sister Xialing whom Meng\\'er Zhang does a good job portraying. Fala Chen also had a great supporting role as Shang-Chi\\'s mother.While the creatures showcased in final act are pretty cool like the Great Protector, I particularly disliked Morris the faceless chicken-pig that accompanied Ben Kingsley\\'s Trevor Slattery and found the addition very unnecessary. Speaking of unnecessary Florian Munteanu\\'s Razor Fist was not needed. I felt all his screen time could have been devoted to the Death Dealer who I was more interested in.I also did feel like they took some tropes and traditions of Asian cinema and did not present anything unique on their own take and in doing so I got this feeling that at least half of the film did not know what it wanted to be other than an Asian American hero in the MCU.To sum it up, a stellar first half, where then Marvel eventually goes back into their comfort zone by the third act. Despite Tony Leung\\'s magic as a performer and Simu Liu\\'s best efforts it is ultimately another okay entry to the MCU as opposed to the top tier level films that took big swings like INFINITY WAR, the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy or the first GUARDIANS. Again, being an Asian myself I wanted to love this film, but I didn\\'t, I just thought it was okay.Two post credits scenes so stay put.7/10.',\n",

And I don\\'t mind them.. Unless they keep on returning to exactly the same scene over and over and over again with that difference that you get to listen to new part of the talk. I don\\'t remember any other movie that was so riddled with flashbacks.Third issue are fights. Now this has to be broken in 2 groups; \"magical fights\" and \"down to earth fights\". The first was done terribly. Camera shake, way too close, badly lighted and confusing as heck. There was some vision, some idea, yes, but it turned into \"cgi slosh\". This could have been done oh-so-much better.. But we got pointless confusing close-ups then camera shaky-shaky moments instead. The second group reminds me of jackie chan movies, you know.. kung-fu stuff, which was great... To some extend.Fourth issue is main character. He\\'s the extend from point earlier. He\\'s like blank-slate punching bag in this show. He has no real emotions and just goes with the flow. He >never< speaks his mind and rather just silently mumbles his agreement for whatever plan others come up with. It was annoying. Really grating. Ok, I don\\'t mind if MC is not an iron man of a character. But I had seen corpses put more action while being decomposing than Shang chi. Also he gets beaten pretty much all the time. There are only 3\\'ish exceptions where he shows real emotions. And again.. shoddy pacing cripples them slightly.The Second character, his friend - Katey (i think).. she was fine. She was active and I couldn\\'t shake this feeling that she\\'s the brains of the team with witty humor, while he\\'s broody muscle man with past.There were few amazing scenes, which i loved alot, really.

              " \"This film is... good,... but a little disappointing.Let's start with the positives. This movie looks incredible. The Chinese elements and Asian-American influences give this film a wonderfully unique style. The fight choreography is some of the cleanest ever seen in the universe. It all looks incredible and clear, with clear lessons learned from the works of Bruce Lee. Simu Liu does an amazing job and I ADORE Shang-Chi and a character. I cannot wait to see more of him in the future.Unfortunately, the writing really lets this movie down in a lot of ways. None of the characters in the film feel like they learn or grow throughout the story, including Shang-Chi. Shang starts out as a trained fighter who loves his dad but condemns his actions and he finishes the film in the exact same spot. I similar thing can be said for his father who also feels very stagnant. Shang's sister is unbelievably one-dimensional filling in as the badass woman type with no further depth beyond her painful American accent. The comic relief characters very much overstay their welcome and become grating as things go on. This is very apparent for the return of Trevor who should have remained nothing more than a 10-second cameo.The story itself is very messy and cliche. At the beginning of the film, we are presented with an amulet that is treated as being very important but disappears at the end of the first act. Shang's journey isn't really motivated with himself, but through an urge to stop whatever his father is doing. It all feels very hallow.I appreciate what this movie will do for Asian representation, but am underwhelmed by it simply as a film on its own, not unlike that of Black Panther.\",\n",
              " 'Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings introduces a new Marvel Character/Avenger, and that\\'s Shang-Chi. The way that the film introduced that character was great. Loved how the film jumps back and forth a few times to tell us about Shang-Chi\\'s past when he was young and how or why he ended up where he is in the present day.The film had so many fight scenes that were amazing and the cinematography that was used to shoot these fight scenes made them 10x better and that\\'s perhaps because the cinematographer of this film is Bill Pope who shot The Matrix (1999) and Sam Raimi\\'s Spider-Man 2 (2004). You could tell for sure that there are a lot of similarities between the fight scenes in Shang-Chi and The Matrix especially that both of them had this \"kung fu\" style of fighting. Loved how sometimes during the fight scenes the \"Dutch tilt\" method was used and it was wide showing the stunning set design around.The film is also visually stunning which I\\'m happy to call one of Marvel\\'s most visually stunning films. It\\'s a treat for the eyes.The comedy in the film was so good and used very carefully in perfect times which is something that scares me whenever I watch a \"Marvel\" film. Because these films are supposed to be \"serious superhero\" films. But, when comedy is used in perfect times, the result will be perfect.Akwafina\\'s acting was very great. Loved her character and am excited to see what her character will have in future MCU Films. Simu Liu was of course the perfect actor for this role but one thing that in my opinion he \"failed at\" are the \"emotional scenes\". This film has so many emotional scenes that discuss \"family\" and the relationship between a father and his son. I felt like Simu Liu couldn\\'t be able to deliver that emotional feeling to the audience because his acting was bad in these emotional scenes. This brings me to Tony Chiu-Wai Leung who plays \"the father\". Leung carried the whole film in my opinion. Whenever there was an emotional scene between the father and his son, Leung was way better at expressing and showing his feelings than Simu Liu.Loved all the visual effects, they were all well made especially that the film has so many. The customs as well are great and loved how sometimes the colors represent Shang-Chi\\'s culture like the \"football varsity jacket\" that was red and grey that Shang-Chi was wearing at the beginning of the film.I got to point out that the last 30 minutes or so of the film are one of the greatest and most enjoyable in the whole MCU.My rating is 8/10.',\n",

'Shang-Chi' is full of beautiful creatures, costumes, martial arts, and acting. Probably the best fighting in the MCU, which makes sense (though Cap and Winter Soldier fighting is my personal favourite). The real Mandarin makes his debut and does not disappoint, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung was fantastic. All the other cast members were very likable as well. A few appearances from other MCU characters, including a surprising one that somewhat redeems himself.A refreshing Marvel superhero movie in that it primarily focuses on itself, but has tons of potential to jump right in with other Marvel storylines.

              " 'With \"Endgame\", the MCU had its well-deserved success in 2019. But how should it continue after that? It was clear that Kevin Feige did not want to quit, of course. But unfortunately I have to say that no film or show after the \"Avengers\" spectacle has really convinced me so far. That\\'s why I was hoping for \"Shang-Chi\" (2021), which should score points above all with spectacular action scenes (inspired by Asian cinema). But after watching the movie, I\\'m unfortunately anything but enthusiastic. \"Shang-Chi\" has great action here and there, but what about the rest?Shaun and his best friend Katy are searching for a meaning in their life when suddenly Shaun\\'s father, a powerful mafia boss with magical rings in his possession, visits his son. The reason is that Shaun was trained to be a killer, but wanted a different life. Sadly his father cannot accept that ...I\\'ll have to spoil small details, but in my opinion \"Shang-Chi\" is not a film that can really be spoiled because it is made like almost every other typical superhero film.First, let\\'s get to the action, which has received so much critical acclaim. Yes, the choreographies are really impressive and beautiful to look at in the first two thirds. This is something that a lot of MCU movies don\\'t do well, which is why I really appreciate the action here too. BUT when the finale is approaching, the action quickly subsides. Because here it unfortunately needed a big CGI battle festival with big creatures and apocalyptic events. This is exactly what was already dealt with critically in \"Civil War\", but Marvel keeps falling into this old superhero-cliché. For the \"Avengers\"-films, that decision is perfectly fine (especially for \"Infinity War\" and \"Endgame\"), but what about the stand alone films? Here you have to keep asking yourself: Where are the other Avengers? Where is Spider-Man, Doctor Strange or Captain Marvel?\"Shang-Chi\" would have worked so much better if the finale had been a personal battle between Shaun and his dad. Instead, you need gigantic demons and CGI battles. Even the green screen work is not always good in my opinion and quickly looks artificial and fake. No matter what you think about the \"Matrix\" sequels, but the fight scenes there are so much more impressive to me because you often only used CGI when you needed it. Or let\\'s watch Asian martial arts films with Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. There was hardly ever any computer trickery because most of these films were shot between the 60s and 80s. At the moment you can rather watch the \"John Wick\"-films if you want to see spectacular and hand-made action. Because \"Shang-Chi\" unfortunately has little to offer apart from the action ...The story is the absolute run-of-the-mill cliché stuff, which is now rather parodied in many of these films. The classic outsider who has problems with his father and still has to learn a lot about himself, but is already so good that he could do it on his own easily. His girlfriend Katy is the necessary sidekick and knocks out the obvious jokes so that the viewer does not get too lost in the drama. Everything is so forced and unnatural that I was bored to death. And Marvel films in particular are supposed to be fun and entertaining. \"Shang-Chi\" wants to repeat the \"Black Panther\" success and shows a superhero who is not white, but in this case of Asian origin. And that\\'s great and important, but in the end we mustn\\'t forget that a film cannot be judged solely on the basis of its intentions. Even \"Black Panther\" was only average for many fans in the end, but it could offer a bit more interesting story elements for me.The MCU is currently suffering from a trivial \"mass taste\" identity. Everything that came after \"Endgame\" can be described in one word: Safe. \"Shang-Chi\" is also designed in such a way that as many people as possible can enjoy the film. It wants to be dark and \"cool\", but at the same time also child-friendly and funny.Another problem are the way too perfect protagonists of these new MCU works. They can often solve all of their problems within one film. At the end of the movie, for example, Shang-Chi has practically nothing that he can improve on. Tony Stark or Peter Parker had to fight and work on themselves in every film and often did not reach their goal by the end of the film. But that makes characters more exciting in many ways. In my opinion, the characters in \"Shang-Chi\" are too superficial with their problems. It may all be heartbreaking and violent on paper, but the execution doesn\\'t seem anything but real. It\\'s a typical movie that feels like a typical movie and sounds like a typical movie.The actors may not be the reason for all of this, but I didn\\'t find any of the acting performances really convincing or interesting. Yes, lead actor Simu Liu is physically capable of doing these great stunts himself and I really appreciate that. But there has to be more when it comes to acting as well. And that applies to everyone in the cast, except maybe Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who plays Shaun\\'s father. He does his job very well, after all he´s in the business for quite a while now. There\\'s also a surprise guest from a previous Marvel movie (I won\\'t name him or her separately), but I\\'ve rarely seen such a pointless character in a movie. This character is only there so that Marvel and Kevin Feige can say, \"Here\\'s our fan service, baby!\"Director Destin Daniel Cretton, who has already made a name for himself in the film business, certainly had the best intentions, as did his talented cameraman Bill Pope (who has already worked for the \"Matrix\" sequels or Sam Raimi\\'s \"Spider-Man\" films), but in the end Marvel and Disney seem to have too much say and want their product to be suitable for the masses. And if you\\'re not a Scorsese or a Nolan, then it\\'s not so easy to get your vision through.One last word to the composer Joel P West, who wrote a (sometimes) beautiful score with Asian influences. In the action, however, the whole thing quickly seems very unimaginative ...Conclusion: \"Shang-Chi\" has finally shown me that Marvel is slowly becoming trivial. It was almost clear that after \"Endgame\" practically nothing could really astonish us anymore, but there was still hope with me. But precisely this hope is crumbling right now. Great action alone is not enough for a film to convince me and \"Shng-Chi\" is the best proof.',\n",

It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong CinemaThe flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.Highly recommended.

As the movie ends, we go into one last restaurant scene. Then in the middle of the credits, we get MORE story. Then after the last of the credits.. even after \"Marvel Studio Cleaning Crew: Bob the Janitor and Mae his wife\", we get ONE more scene at the end.

The director, Destin Daniel Cretton, manages to create a new mythology, both inspired by the comics and the Chinese tradition. The visual effects are great, even outstanding during certain moments, as well as the concept design of all the mythical creatures. Finally, the music really meshes amazingly with the scenes, especially when there's more action and emotion. A new modern superhero has arrived and he's ready to deliver some punches. This movie really pulls off a great origin story that proves, once again, the endless possibilities the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to offer.\",\n",
              " \"Story is balanced - contains multiple dark topics and dark events but it has strong comedy vibes too. And finally, a movie where trailer didn't betray all the story, it has even some magic in it. Recommended to all fans of kung fu and to all fans of Harry Potter.\",\n",

              " \"Shang-Chi is one of those movies that starts off strong and never stops entertaining you. From the beginning, I felt connected to the characters and the story made sense.Shang-Chi had just the right amount of funny comments or jokes that you can still take it seriously, and at the right time, everyone was serious. I must admit, I had my doubts about Awkwafina when I saw her as the role of Katy, I was afraid she would crack jokes the entire move, but that's not the case. When the time was right, there was a joke, when the time came to be serious, she displayed her strong acting skills and carried her role perfectly.Simu Liu was nothing short of perfection for me from start to finish, but to be honest, that's what I expected.Both Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Fala Chen were incredible as well as the rest of the cast. Everyone played their part and played it well.I feel like the movie was a great story and we took a great ride alongside the ten rings, their origin and progression of power. The father was a villain, but he had his reasons and was made to feel human.I have no bad comments regarding this movie other than I don't want to wait a whole year to see part II.\",\n",

The choreography was by far the best in any Marvel movie. This movie felt like Ip Man with a mythical story added to it. The action was impeccable. The story was unique and wasn't very generic.

              " 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the latest comic-book inspired action-fantasy film from Marvel-Disney Studios. Daniel Destin Crettin is the director.The film stars Simu Liu (Canadian television\\'s \"Kim\\'s Convenience\") as the title character. Known as Shaun in the beginning of the narrative, he\\'s a late-20-something who works as a valet at a San Francisco hotel with his carefree best friend Katy (Nora \"Awkwafina\" Lum). Seemingly okay with eking by earning a working-class living, Shaun\\'s life changes when he receives a mysterious postcard. The next day a group of hitmen attack him on a bus, forcing him to reveal his potent martial arts prowess.Turns out, \"Shaun\" was born to Wenwu (veteran Chinese cinema star Tony Leung), a crime boss in China whose career has literally lasted centuries, thanks to a mysterious set of rings worn around his lower arms that grant magic powers-- including, apparently, immortality. Shang Chi\\'s mother Ying Li (Fala Chen) was a resident of a mysterious, magical Chinese city-- think Shangri-La or Black Panther\\'s Wakanda. Possessing her own magic-inspired martial arts skills, she convinced Wenwu to temporarily leave behind his crime empire and start a family. It didn\\'t last, leading to a family tragedy and Shang\\'s self-imposed exile in America.The plot has to do with Wenwu\\'s insistence on bringing Shang and his sister Xialing (Menger Zhang) back into the family fold, so they can collectively find the entrance to the mystic city, conquer the inhabitants and reunite with Ying Li, who Wenwu insists whispers to him from beyond the grave. Shang and Xialing want nothing to do with their father\\'s criminal empire, but Wenwu is not above brutality to convince cooperation.The film takes dramatic liberties with the original source material. Part of this is legally necessary, as the comic book Shang Chi\\'s father was originally Yellow Peril villain Fu Manchu-- officially owned by the Sax Rohmer estate. Additionally, the original comics posed Shang as an agent of Great Britain\\'s MI-6, with a mostly British supporting cast, including someone who \"playfully\" would refer to Shang as (an ethnic slur for Chinese/Asians). All of that backdrop is wisely eschewed for an all new set of allies and adversaries. Katy provides comic relief and as a low-key audience stand-in. As a 2nd-generation child of immigrants she also highlights the vantage point of someone who is very \"Americanized\" who bristles at \"old school values and customs\" of her parents/grandparents but striggles to fulfill her own pathway in life.Simu Liu gives a solid journeyman\\'s performance as Shang Chi. He handles the action as well as the dramatic and comedic components. Still, it\\'s something of a role that\\'s semi-mired in exposition, because viewers mainly get to see his younger life in flashbacks.The action is well choreographed, including ballet-like scenes of combat and courtship alike, with nods to fantasy physics but never egregiously outlandish. The film also has beautiful cinematography courtesy of Bill Pope (his cinematography credits include \\'The Matrix\\' and the first three \\'Spider-Man\\' films).Possibly the most fully realized performance is that of Tony Leung, who gets to portray a more in-depth villain than is typically featured in most comic book movies. There are other solid supporting roles played by Michelle Yeoh and Sir Ben Kingsley.The climax of the film is filled with special-effects-based wonders including creatures of all sorts and Mulan-style fights between army legions. This can get dizzying for the non-comics-steeped layperson, so this may be overwhelming for some viewers. But the overall narrative is satisfying.The film takes place independent of any particular goings-in in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it is only a post-credits coda that links it to the greater Marvel pantheon. This film can be enjoyed by itself without watching any of the \"Avengers\" franchises.It remains to be seen whether \"Legend of the Ten Rings\" makes the Shang Chi character a household name alongside Captain America, Iron Man and the Rest but it is more than a worthy entry to the current phase of the Marvel movie saga.',\n",
              " \"I just finished watching this and all i can say is this movie is soo unique. From the action to the atmosphere it just made this experience so great words can't even explain. I'm so eager to see what marvel has in store for us next!\",\n",
              " 'I have already watch this movie three times this movie was awesome. It had everything from action to comedy and the really embraced the Chinese culture in this movie. But I was more excited for the post credit scene and I think we have not seen the last of shang chi.',\n",
              " 'What more do you want?I honestly didn\\'t want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn\\'t even crack a rib seems silly.But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a \"bro\" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn\\'t require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he\\'s lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn\\'t ever go past the \"you must have honor\" trope that infects a movie like \"Mulan\"',\n",
              " \"Ok, so I really liked it. In particular I really liked the characters. I loved the hero's journey that Shang Chi went on. I loved his relationship with Katy and his sister. They were all likable, and badass in their own way. And you could empathize with them. I thought this was a very strong villain. Not just physically, but very compelling. A lot of MCU villains can come across as very one note. But he was complex and layered. So that was great to see. And of course they were all strongly acted as well. Akwafina is maybe the least strongest out of the main cast (Check out The Farewell if you really want to see her shine) but like, she is still is good in this.I loved the fight choreography in this. Probably some of the best fight scenes you get in the MCU. And I loved the visuals used in those scenes as well. Some shots were truly stunning to watch.One downside I had though is that I wanted to know more about how the magic works. Like the final battle between Shang Chi and his father he has suddenly mastered his mother's magic/fighting. And I know the movie kind of pokes fun of this at the end by having Shang Chi tell his friends that he had 1 day of training. But seriously, how did that happen? Is it just because he's his mother's son? Is it because he was specifically in that place? I just needed a little more backstory/explanation. Also, the Wong/Abomination fight (which was totally spoiled in the trailers) didnt really do anything and just added more questions. I guess they needed a way to set up Wong for the mid credits scene though. And that mid credits scene in general just raised more questions for me. Like why is Bruce back to being in his human form? It clearly takes place after the events of Endgame (judging by his arm sling) so why is he not in his Professor Hulk form?I thought the comedy was good for the most part. I think it worked well with the beginning and ending of the film. But didnt always land during the more meatier parts of the film. Theres maybe a few other elements I could nitpick but for the most part I really liked this film. Im not sure where I would rank it yet. I think probably a top 10-er.\",\n",
              " 'This movie features the lesser known Marvel superhero Shang-Chi, who\\'s a former assassin from China hiding out in the USA. He goes back to China when assassins come after him, who are also after his sister. It turns out his father is the real Mandarin who sadly doesn\\'t get to meet Iron Man. His impersonator from \"Iron Man 3\", played by Ben Kingsley is there and is a lot of fun. It\\'s a nice throwback to the older Marvel films and a good way to satisfy the fans. I like how there\\'s two people of the same gender who are not love interests.We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It\\'s still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie. I recall an interview when the actor said a lot of Chinese people are called Bruce Lee. That makes the documentary \"The Problem With Apu\" even more idiotic. ***1/2.',\n",
              " \"Shang-Chi has instantly entered my top 5 of Marvel movies. There is so much to adore about this movie. The visuals are beautiful, the villain is compelling, the last sequence isn't very predictable, as superhero movies can often be. The characters all have a level of depth that is often missing from the supporting characters in superhero movies, and I was pleased that they didn't marginalize Xialing as it would've been easy to do. I don't know much about the different disciplines of martial arts, but it seems very similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender in how they drew inspiration from different real world fighting styles for different fighters in the movie. If I compare the acting to the other movies I consider the best to produced by Marvel (Infinity War, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier, etc.), Shang-Chi is a notch below, but it blows every other Marvel movie out of the water when it comes to action and choreography. The bus scene in the first act has easily become my favorite sequence in any Marvel film. Origin films often fall into the same traps, but Shang-Chi doesn't, maybe because many didn't know much about the character. But even so, typical tropes like training sequences were done better in Shang-Chi, and the story didn't linger on his youth too much.\",\n",

              " \"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!\",\n",

The actors did a great job, the cinematography was great and CGI was spot on. The only complaint is that the movie felt very cringe ish at some times, especially during the first 10 minutes. But the movie gradually got better, still having some cringey scenes during the run. I know some people have their complaints on Awkwafina but she really did a great job. Simu Liu's character was lacking at times though but I'd definitely say he has one of the best debut characters in terms of personality.*And why people are reviewing this now is because it was released on September 1th in a few countries.Also spoiler, Abomination's character only did a very brief appearance, it was so brief so that I was unable to even film him.Also, we have another bad guy who will show up later in the MCU ;)\",\n",
              " \"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.\",\n",

Forced jokes, the storyline was weak, the antagonist who was hundred years old was even weaker, I could go on and on.If they thought that including acrobatics in the action scenes was going to make this movie better, well, let me tell you I've seen lots better in low budget martial arts films.A waste of time and money.

The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting\\nThe plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more.

A young adult trying to navigate through his life far away from his family in the city of San Francisco. His partner in crime is his best female friend Katy (Awkwafina).Simu Liu\\'s character arc in this film is not significant. Although he makes\\na solid protagonist, his own character development is de minimis. Awkwafina, by contrast, steals the film as the ordinary person caught up in the epic power struggle. Her trademark zingers and bemused quips make her the perfect foil against the escapist superhero world that she- and we as the audience- are thrust into. Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) is a subtly effective Marvel villain with a compelling family backstory; he is a cinematic antagonist with the most idealism and righteous sense of purpose since Bill the Butcher in \"Gangs of New York\".Michelle Yeoh as Shang-Chi\\'s aunt Jiang Nan has again some great fighting scenes which stand up to her wonderful performance in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\".

              " \"Marvel tries to show only greatness of china. And half of the movie doesn't have any action very boaring movie. Total waste of time. No comparison with dr strange movie and Ironman movie. This is (minus)-10 star movie.\",\n",
              " 'LikesGreat Pacing:\\nShang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi\\'s combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.Character Development:\\nThe trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang\\'s life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.The Surprise Cameo:\\nCan\\'t say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character\\'s return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.The Cultural Influence:\\nLike Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.The CGI\\nFinally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.The Acting:\\nA great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi\\'s cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.The Comedy:\\nAwkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It\\'s all done so well and I was very happy with the results.The Action:\\nMy bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film\\'s action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It\\'s exciting, it\\'s dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.A Bit More Adult:\\nThe movie is definitely showing Marvel\\'s modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.Some of the political moments:\\nWhile nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, \"Look what I had to do,\" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it\\'s very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.A Little More Action:The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I\\'ll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.The VERDICT:Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero\\'s quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5\\nMovie Overall: 8.5-9.0.',\n",

The Marvel Cinematic Universe strikes gold yet again & can do no wrong! Director Destin Daniel Cretton has given us one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best origin stories. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. It's awesome to finally see the Kung Fu fighting style, utilized in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are awe-inspiring.

              " 'What do you call a man on a mission to keep his family safe? What do you call a man who just wants to fit in where he belongs? A new kind of hero. We have entered into Phase 4 of the greatest movie franchise in movie history. We have seen battles, we have seen so many Marvel characters in the last 12 years come to life, but this new kind of hero comes to us by surprise.Who here knows about Shang-Chi? I just learned about on Friday and from what I read - I can honestly tell you his story is one for the history books. I can\\'t give out the whole movie to you or anything to spoil the movie, but this movie was different from the other movies in the MCU.I was in shock from the very beginning to the end, there were a lot of \"easter eggs\" linking all the way back to Tony Stark, oops, I think I said a little too much, but I will say this -\\nThis movie defied everything in the natural and supernatural realm of not only the physical, but the soul. It dives deep into the soul of a person, and that is what Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is all about.I have to give a huge shout-out to Simu Liu - like I said before - I have never heard of Shang-Chi up until recently, but he gave the role a new meaning and a new identity.Now without giving too much away, with every Marvel movie, there are some credit scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. That\\'s all I am saying.So in essence - I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: 11 stars.',\n",
              " \"Shang Chi movie review-\\nSome spoilers\\nPros:\\nThe story. I thought this movie would be boring just because it's a character that I am completely unfamiliar with but it actually was very interesting. Not just the plot but the origin and the backstory on peoples lives, I really loved the idea of it all. It incorporated a lot of cool Asian culture as well as some hip-hop American vibes and culture too. It was a very awesome combination.The characters you don't see in the trailer. One of the main characters is Shang-Chi's sister, the girl with the short hair and bangs (left in picture). She is by far the coolest character in this entire movie and I don't know WHY she is not on the front of more posters and more trailers! Katy played by Awkwafina isn't just the person in the movie that's the comedy, there are others too and although she is funny she actually has a lot more depth to her character and does have some serious moments, she's in the whole movie. I liked her more than I thought I would.The fight scenes and action. Shang Chi (Shaun) is extremely skilled in Kung Fu and actually has a fighting style similar to Batman. If he had a cape it would be awesome, but I know his character doesn't need it. There are very cool scenes that reminded me of scenes in Wakanda but in a mystical Asian land where there are dragons and other cool fictional creatures. The sets are beautiful!Some cameos and also the music. I won't spoil anything but there are some pretty cool cameos in this movie that definitely set up the world of the Marvel universe. Although the one cameo we'd all love to see we cannot. RIP Stan Lee. This film actually had some really cool music, the main character actually sings a song or two on the soundtrack as well as some really cool hip-hop music. I suggest to go check it out!Cons:Some plot holes. There were some moments were I got confused with some of the details of the plot. There were things that were not answered you have to figure out on your own. It's good to go to the movies with people so that you can talk about it afterwards and catch things. It is one of those movies where you may have to see it again to catch some things that you missed. I wish they made it a little bit more clear.The weird friendship between Katy and Shaun. In the movie you see that the two leads are BEST friends, they work together. But in the real world that is not very realistic. They kind of hint that there may be something that comes of it, some moments where I totally thought it was going to be romantic. I just wish they would either make it romantic or not, not somewhere in between. I'm sure there will be more movies where they may make them a couple eventually.The Mandarin. For those of you who don't know, that is the father of Shang Chi and Xialing (the real one not the drunk one on Iron Man 3). He is a very tough man, a villain. I don't like the aspect of making his father the villain even though that's the way I'm sure it is in the comic books. It just seems sad and not a good story that his dad sucks. I wish Marvel had some more Mufasas.All in all though it was great! Stay for all the credits there's two! It was better than I thought.8/10.\",\n",

And it\\'s done quite well. They\\'ve managed to present a whole new world inside the one we\\'ve already had at this point throughout this one short movie. They\\'ve packed it with alright characters, adventures and action. So as a piece of the bigger narrative this movie is quite well made.But to me it falls short as a standalone picture. It feels so formulaic at this point that it hurts sometimes. All the twists are obvious from miles ahead. The threat of \"the end of the world\" is so regular at this point that it\\'s impossible to be invested in it and the stakes don\\'t feel significant at all.And I hate the fact that even a well made movie like this one leaves you feeling empty after watching.

It's the origin story of the title character, a martial arts superhero, but he is not nearly as well known as Spider-Man or Captain America, so we are not treated to yet another iteration of Uncle Ben's demise. Instead we are given a fleshed out story of a tragic family, one without easily defined villains. Shang-Chi joined the Marvel Comic scene in 1973 in an attempt to create a character that could cash in on the Kung Fu craze at the height of Bruce Lee's popularity. He had his own book for many years, interacting with other Marvel heroes, and if he has not been a Marvel regular in recent decades, Shang-Chi has never gone away, and retained the loyalty of many hardcore fans.Like all origin movies, SHANG-CHI begins with some exposition and back story, specifically concerning his father, Wenwu, played by Tone Leung, a power hungry thousand year old immortal, who wields the Ten Rings of the title, a fearsome mystical weapon of an unknown source. Only when he meets Li, played by Fala Chen, a fighter from the hidden realm of Ta-Lo, does he find someone who is his equal in combat. Falling in love, Wenwu forsakes his violent ways, and starts a family with Li. But in every hero's origin story there must be a tragedy, and when Li is murdered by Wenwu's rivals, he seeks vengeance, becoming the villain he once was, and teaching his son and daughter how to become deadly assassins. When we meet Shang-Chi, well played by Simu Liu, he is a twenty something Chinese immigrant living in San Francisco making a living as a parking valet with his best friend/girlfriend, Katy, played by Awkwafina, having broken from his father's world. But as with most stories centering on estranged families, the plot turns on them being drawn back together, and Wenwu needs a pair of pendants belonging to Shang-Chi and his sister that were gifts from their mother because they are essential, he believes, if he is to free his deceased spouse from the Dark Realm, whose entrance lies inside Ta-Lo. And if Shang-Chi doesn't want to go along with Dad's plan, too bad. It all comes to a head in an epic battle in Ta-Lo in a CGI heavy third act - pretty much a staple for the MCU.I liked this movie because it has plenty of energy, with great well done action scenes, along with some spectacularly staged martial arts battles. It also has a lot of heart, with characters who are easy to become invested in. And this lighter touch is welcome after the dark turns of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. In Tony Leung, it has a great villain with an understandable motive, something essential with any good super hero film. Simu Liu is an appealing lead, and he's matched all the way by Awkwafina's Katy, an underachiever who discovers special skills. I am not always impressed with CGI laden film making, but I don't mind it here because I actually care about the all too human characters involved in the action. The finale in Ta-Lo is supposed to be the high point of the movie, but for me, nothing beats the battle on the careening city bus on the streets of San Francisco early in the film, where Shang-Chi first shows his true martial arts prowess against his father's minions, led by the fearsome Razor Fist, played by the physically impressive Florian Monteneau. Michelle Yeoh has a part as a village elder, and out of nowhere, Ben Kingsley returns as actor Trevor Slattery, thus redeeming what for many of us fans what was one of the more disappointing villain tweaks from IRON MAN 3.An early scene at a Hong Kong fight club firmly establishes that all this is happening in the MCU with appearances by Benedict Wong's character from DOCTOR STRANGE, and the Abomination from THE HULK. Wong returns in a post credits scene that clearly sets up Shang-Chi and Katy for the big leagues in the next phase of the MCU. Will they learn where the Ten Rings came from, and maybe does THE ETERNALS have anything to do with it? And there is the dangling plot thread of what exactly happened when Shang-Chi was sent to kill the man responsible for his mother's death when he was 14; it was the event that estranged him from his father. Something tells me we will find out in some future installment. I can hardly wait.\",\n",
              " '\"I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.\"Marvel Studios\\' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we\\'ve had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we\\'d get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it\\'s easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there\\'s a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn\\'t seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There\\'s much more to be made from him, but with future installments we\\'ll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He\\'s a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He\\'s flawed, but there\\'s depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I\\'ve been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can\\'t wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng\\'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she\\'s also great. What they\\'ll do with her next should be interesting.From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn\\'t that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It\\'s not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It\\'s refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!',\n",

Pro-tip, at some point in your lives seek this gem out ! This is going to be very solid UHD HDR blu-ray and the 3D is very impressive albeit some minor cross-talk but forgivable as the are some very intricate set pieces for the left and right eye to navigate via the post conversion 3D.

The story arch is well paced and unfolds gradually so one can get emotionally involved with the films characters , the acting is superb on all fronts from the films talented ensemble . The directing and pacing is spot on.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and one of my favorite entries as a whole.

Outside of the name Shang Chi, his father being evil and one of the villains Razorfist the movie was completely different from the comic character. In the comics his father is Fu Manchu. He does NOT have the 10 rings, the Mandrian does though they are actually finger sized rings. Razorfist has a normal blade in place of his hand not a bloody light saber. Fu Manchu does have an extended life but it it due to a serum he takes. I don't remember Shang Chi having a sister in the 100+ comics I read. At one point he did have an identical twin or maybe it was a clone. So again it WAS a good movie it just ruined it for me that they completely changed the story from the comics.\",\n",

              " '\"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it\\'s an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung\\'s who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh\\'s who played as Ying Nan, Meng\\'er Zhang\\'s who played as Xialing and Awkwafina\\'s who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie.

I was concerned Awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops. She was not the comic relief! They gave that honour to the Shakespearean stage giant, Ben Kingsley, Our own, homegrown 🇨🇦 Simu Liu was perfect for the part and his performance was world class. I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design. Upon leaving the cinema, I was going to give the movie a 9 (superb) out of 10, but after reflecting on it, I don't know what they could have done to make it better, so, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}\",\n",

I mean, Marvel films have this requirement for suspension of disbelief by default, but this film kind of explains very little and the character's interaction is shallow and not very meaningful. The end is predictable, everything looks artificial.Perhaps we are all vaccinated against Marvel's all over the place magic to a point that everything looks familiar, boring and flat. Or perhaps the film is just not that great.My big problem with this film is the bus sequence at the start. It eeps going downhill. I mean.. if you can make turns with the bus, why does it keep going down all the time? Turn left twice, it will go uphill instead of downhill and decelerate, then turn to any side and it should come to a standstill. Not very clever, guys.\",\n",

The only criticism I have is how the final fight got a bit too CGI-heavy. It really didn't need the super fantastical elements and definitely took away the character development the story was building up to. It kind of just felt like the higher-ups said a Marvel movie needs something grandiose despite the rest of the film was kept grounded.Other than this, and the fact that a side character was able to pull a MVP hit out of thin air, the movie is very enjoyable.

              " \"After a brief gap of theatrical release (not considering Black Widow as it had a partial release), MARVEL is back in theatres introducing to the characters of the new phase of their universe. Shang Chi The Legend Of Ten Rings is a standalone film but equally also serves as an important piece of puzzle in the events linking to the web series' and upcoming movies. It goes without saying that watching all the recently released series on Disney+ is as important as following these movies in order.As the trailer shows and also the name suggests Shang Chi is a movie whose action heavily lean towards the martial arts and individual battles. It is a different watch as compared to other MARVEL movies which involve a lot of hi tech dependent action. The movie hardly wastes any time on the lead character's introduction and straightway jumps into the 'purpose'. Having experienced the 'blip' after the infinity war, the normal people aren't surprised anymore when supernatural things and high octane action happens around them. Hence the character here is hardly wasting any time on hiding their identities from the public. The storyline is pretty straightforward and the movie has strong resemblance to Black Panther because of the lead character's connection to his place of origin. The action sequences are shot brilliantly and some of the camera and lighting work is mind blowing. The movie relies on good hand to hand combat almost until the climax and I believe if MARVEL had gone for an R rating, the action sequences would have been much better to watch. I personally think some incidents happening around climax were way too convenient. Last but not the least, the background music just elevates most scenes into a whole new level.Simu Liu has what it takes to bring the Asian heritage to the superhero universe. The movie doesn't test much of his emotional side and I believe we will get to see more in the upcoming movies. Tony Leung shines in his powerful antagonist role and Awkwafina drives the comical side of things as Shang Chi's close buddy who is almost a sidekick. Rest of the cast have done a decent job and do look out for a surprise funny cameo ;-)MARVEL expands its universe with Shang Chi by exploring a different culture and heritage in the superhero genre. It is a satisfying watch for a MARVEL fan and a great watch for any action movie fans.\",\n",

Unnecesearily taking the focus of the plot.Story plot is so basic, when you look back at what happened in the movie, yeah, nothing much happens really, it is like 3 proper events and rest is just to prolong the movie for no reason.Things that happen action wise in the movie, arent quite connected and I often got a feeling something happens out of nowhere, it can be predicted always, but still it is not logical for it to happen actually, it is just that to plot is so obvious that you know such illogical action will happen.And personal touch to it, I prefer when fantasy has its limitations as well, when you know what characters are capable of in that fantasy world, I really dont like when all of sudden some character pulls of superpower move or some other capability that was never earlier mentioned or done, and that move just changes everything makes him beat everyone.',\n",

The story is good if consider standalone which it is but I have problems with other aspects of movie elements. The entire movie is shooted in closed studio environment with huge set pieces (Marvel is doing such things for last many movies e.g, the last 2 Avengers movies). It is very very very stupid to look at and the non sensical vfx. Still remember the first Iron man movie in which the original and vfx elements are hard to distinguish and have had a good balance in reality and fantasy world. The movie is forcing the humours too in some cases. In some case they tried to mimic Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. This movie certainly have some asian vibe in movie making style but I think there were manipulation in making by studio over creator. The music of the movie is good. Overall it's a good movie. I am going to give any special attention for other upcoming marvel movies( Maybe because I left behind my fantasy world).

              " \"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.Main Character\\nRelative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.Supporting Characters\\nAwkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.Story\\nThe story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.Script\\nThe script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.Style\\nThe film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.Overall\\nOverall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.Rating - 8/10.\",\n",

This movie had a poor ending with little emotional catharsis. The ultimate conflict was resolved with CGI, magic, and deus ex machinas, like the average action blockbuster, which might have been acceptable if it had emotional depth or moral complexity, but it didn't.Overall, the movie was a typical superhero film about family bonds with Kung Fu and dragons.

His inner demons of unable to help his mother felt meh because he was just a kid when it happened. It was more of his father's fault for not having any security or maids in the house. Its a large house and he is a well off man, I am sure he could afford some security.Having some security doesn't mean the mom couldn't be killed too. Maybe the mom died trying to protect one of the maid or the children. It'll added more stakes and trauma to the poor kids.The ten rings were never fully explored too.

Shang-Chi never expressing wanting to be worthy of the ten rings also makes them hollow. They are just as sentimental as a normal sword. A weapon basically.

Beginning in the first of many gorgeously choreographed and shot sequences, we're introduced to Shang-Chi's father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and mother Li (Fala Chen) also entailing the awesome power of the Ten Rings which Xu currently has in his possession. What follows is a heart-pounding and ridiculously entertaining adventure movie with true heart.Filled with beautiful performances not least from everyone already mentioned and including Awkwafina as Shaun's best friends Katy and Meng'er Zhang as sister Xialing, there's plenty here to adore on screen not even getting to the truly awe-inspiring action set pieces with the best fight scenes I've seen in recent memory. Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) is very quickly becoming one of my favourite directors having produced three incredible pieces of cinema in the last 8 years. It's great to see that his passion for storytelling and independent spirit still shines through his latest here while also staying true to the Marvel fan base (I really did not expect a certain character to show up but made for some really comical moments).The visual effects are of course stunning but what makes them stand out here are how they're incorporated with the beautiful landscapes to enhance the feeling of authentically experiencing Shaun's heritage and getting wrapped up in the culture that the filmmakers so wonderfully explore. This is how origin stories should be made! The creature design is also incredible and is an integral element to making the final sequences all the more breathtaking.Please do yourselves a favour and see this on the biggest screens possible, please support your local cinema and stay safe my friends.\",\n",

I'll probably see it again, and might well enjoy it more next time.\",\n",

Tony Leung, as the misguided villain trying to resurrect his wife and Shaun's mother, is the breakout star here, and his storyline - along with Leung's acting - is so magnificent that it sort of overshadows the other characters, including Shaun. This film is exciting, yet also heartwarming.\",\n",
              " \"I knew nothing about the comic book character and was curious how a martial arts character fits into the Avengers universe. The trailer didn't make me all that excited, but after seeing the movie I know why. SO MUCH is not shown in the previews, and it is all amazing content. There were a lot of surprises from characters to choreography, style to substance, and action to emotion. The film makes the complexity of family love its core, and that's what makes Shang-Chi such a riveting story. The villain is not a bad guy. His motive is love, not power. Despite what advantage the Ten Rings gives him, his current life is a transformed one for the better, until the indomitable enemy that is grief comes into his life.While, yes, this is an origin story, it doesn't feel like it in the typical MCU formula, which is very relieving. Shang-Chi doesn't go through training. He's already trained. His enemy isn't a pop-up for fighting's sake. It's his father who conjures conflict to fight against or try to love. Adding in the sibling complexity gives the movie more layers and more emotional stakes that are pretty raw throughout and huge in the third act. They wish their father would love them their way, not his, and try desperately to sober his longing to be rid of his grief. It makes all the balls-to-wall fantasy that's exponentially unleashed.And with this movie, Marvel tested its bravery wisely by leveraging the gorgeous art and culture of China. The fights choreographed more like dancing is so captivating. The rich, calm soundtrack that plays sensually throughout ramps you into the grand fantasy in the third act.Shang-Chi has no flaws that I can find. Acting, characters, story, soundtrack, script, and settings. None of it is weak. Shang-Chi is the best solo Marvel character film since Winter Soldier, and may surpass it.\",\n",
              " \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.\",\n",

              " 'Watched Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings - despite the movie title sounding like one of those 1940s black and white \"Detective Dee and the....\" types, the film is visually stunning: stunning scenery, magical creatures, gorgeous costumes, no-holds-barred fight scenes that are as much dancing as fighting, you name it.I do have issues, however. The first is that I think Marvel was so worried about offending China or the Chinese people that the film comes across as very safe. Far too much on its dignity. If the film were a job interview, it would have been for the position of senior Vice President at the Chinese equivalent of the Louvre. Even Akwafina, who I usually count on to deliver a raunchy belly-laugh of a good time, was very composed and restrained.I\\'m also wondering why they bothered including Shang-Chi\\'s sister. She doesn\\'t really *do* anything except be moody and resentful for the majority of the film. Even in the after-scene, she\\'s not there. As far as I can tell, the entire point of her inclusion in the film is to get Shang-Chi to Macau (bonus points for it not being the overused Hong Kong or Singapore!).Dignity or not, there was plenty of opportunity where they could have upped the humour quotient. The Chinese people are dignified - famous for it - but they also have a ribald and sophisticated sense of humour. I would have *loved* to see sly digs at Western culture, more commentary on differences between East and West (you can\\'t tell me a guy spends his life in an isolated Chinese compound or in the States then just seamlessly segues to Macau\\'s urban lifestyle!), that kind of thing - more than the stereotypical \"When are you getting married? When are you going to get a real job?\" conversation. Basically, they could have really *done* something with this movie, over and above a superhero story.One thing I *really* want to see is a guide to the creatures we see in the film. They are so beautifully rendered! The Fu Dogs, for example - I was mesmerized watching the tiny little movements - ear flicks, muscle twitches as if reacting to a bug bite, the movement of the fur and mane: magnificent! But there were so many others I have no clue what they were other than they looked like Chinese mythological creatures and I would love to know more about them.',\n",

Meh.Also, what's even the deal with the ten rings? The movie is about the legend of the ten rings but the most explanation we've got from it was in the credit scene.

I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects.

It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile.

When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world.

Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he\\'s funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they\\'ve known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we\\'ve known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again.

Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song \"Hotel California\" at the top of my lungs.This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother\\'s village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021. By Heather S., KIDS FIRST!',\n",
              " \"Shang-Chi is arguably the most original and entertaining origin story that Marvel's delivered in quite some time. Coming from someone who's slowly starting to get superhero fatigue from both sides of the aisle, this one delivers. It's a spectacle, and has a family drama that feel's Shakespearean at times. In many ways this is how I wanted the live-action version of Mulan to be.\",\n",

Exploiting every possible trope and going into stereotype territory in every little thing. Seriously. Roll back a little. Most characters underdeveloped and a grey faceless bland. Every character is toned down and underacted on top of that. Even fantastic characters they already had, like Mandarin , toned down for no reason. In general very forgettable, predictable and average Marvel movie, with no critical elements for the saga.',\n",

Still, It\\'s entertaining, visually stunning and it\\'s out of the MCU\\'s pattern which is great. However, I\\'m not convinced of the Mandarin\\'s motives. It kinda lacks evilness ( \"She\" is his weakness and that\\'s why He\\'s been easily manipulated by a beast and that kinda sucks).

This pops up through the rest of the movie.It just didn't hit the emotional marks enough for me to care. The ending fell in to the usual tropes of too much on-screen mayhem.It is gorgeous.

              " \"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie. Soulful, cultural and action-packed.\",\n",

And to be honest they will be pleased and they SHOULD watch this in theatres. You will get everything you need from a Marvel flick.Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings gives a new look at a new hero. It\\'s fresh and it\\'s entertainment at best. To start with positive aspects, the performance as usual are Good. Marvel never misses their castings. Everyone gave their best. Especially the leads Liu and Lueng. Both portrayed themselves perfectly. I was expecting Awkwafina to be a cringe, but she didn\\'t disappointed. Action just brilliant, flawless. The screenplay is elegant. Seeing what new Marvel is showing and what more is about to come will crave fans and everyone for more. Especially the concept of Ten Rings. The mysticism and spiritual material is displayed brilliantly. Fantasy at it\\'s peak. The CGI is just.. flawless as usual. Works tooo damn neat.The bad aspects of the movie I consider is the Wenvu\\'s (Leung) unsatisfactory agenda. He\\'s clearly a brilliant intimidating villian but with his agenda, he seems nothing but a Delusional guy. The Wong and Abomination arc shown in the trailers fails to deliver any justice. The guy, so they say \"Death Dealer\" was supposed to be a prominent badass, but they wasted his potential. And Marvel can\\'t keep re-using the formula of \"Big Third Act\", \"Good vs. Evil\", with loads of CGI, they have to use and start giving new screenplays for climax. (also the last thing with Katy being sudden Hawkeye in the climax is just.. facepalm. No way they did that!)Nevertheless, the movie works fine. Along with superb cinematography, good direction and decent background score. Go watch this movie, you\\'ll enjoy and have a good time. Must watch.

              " \"I've been asking myself, why is it that I didn't really like the avenger movie's? I realized it's because that though the movies can be split up into nearly 5 hours. Each individual character starts to get less and less time as the roster of different characters builds over the years. Therefore watching an origin story movie for me is much more interesting. Focus is on just a few characters and they can shine as the writing aims to let them bloom. Rather tham play second fiddle to more established characters.With that being said, what is Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings movie all about and is this movie worth seeing? The movie at its core is about Shang Chi (Simu Liu), a young man living in San Francisco working at a hotel parking cars with his friend Katy (Awkwafina) very normal one would think until one day while heading home one the bus with his friend Katy, Shang Chi is attacked by a man with a sword for an arm and several other fighters....After the fight there is exposition given to Katy of what happened and that Shang needs to go to Macau in China to rescue his sister Xialing. From there the story begins to open up. The movie itself has amazing and seamless cgi, that bring alternate dimensions to life. The colouring is so beautiful and the design of all the creatures is impeccable. The movie has many comedic moments and isn't super serious, many of these comedic moment come from the excellent Ben Kingsley as the almost random chatacter of Trevor and also Katy who is an excellent charismatic sidekick.Overall this is a great and I like these single character focused movies rather than avenger movies where although the stakes might be higher. Personalities drown each other out and nobody gets over as much as they should.\",\n",

Its something quite fresh and unexpected, some scenes in the first 45 minutes are a bit weak and could be preformed better, the last hour or so is the absolute best. (they could've gone into more details of the rings themselves and they might want to rethink the cast next time) The music on the other hand was okay it was the final battle where the music stood out. The cameos are crazy! I have to give full points to the hair and makeup department and the costume designs, the costumes where awesome!

              " \"This movie is a blast and then some. It is, just like Black Panther was, a Marvel movie and it's own thing at the same time. It brings a much needed freshness to MCU. The story is about Shang-Chi, a Kung Fu fighter, who is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. Is this the same Ten Rings organization from Iron Man and Iron Man 3? I'll let the movie explain.Director Destin Daniel Cretton successfully blends in his culture in the Marvel format, but also keeps it real, authentic and most importantly communicates a very personal story effectively. At the heart of it, this is a movie about a dysfunctional family dealing with their family drama. I'm not going to talk about what the drama is as that will be a spoiler. But with that drama comes some of the best Kung-Fu fights I've seen on the big screen in a long time.Simu Liu as Shang-Chi and Awkwafina as his best friend are well known stars, but after this movie they will be upgraded to superstar status. They were brilliant in the movie and were yin to each other's yang. Where Simu Liu brought the punches, Awkwafina brought. The punchlines. They complimented each other to create the perfect balance. Another character that left an impression on me is Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as Shang-Chi's father. The love-hate relationship between him and Shang-Chi is relatable and just so heartbreaking.Rest of the star cast is also brilliantly casted and this movie has some of the best written supporting characters. The core group consists of Fala Chen as Shang-Chi's mother who is the soul of this movie, Meng'er Zhang as his sister who is just as much of a kick ass as Shang-Chi and Michelle Yeoh as his aunt who becomes his guide and teacher. There is also a surprise character in the movie that I loved, but I am not going to talk about it and spoil it for you guys.This is a Marvel product so you know that the VFX & CGI are industry best. Adding to that are the beautiful Cinematography and the fast paced Camera Work. Each and every fight sequence is meticulously handled and spectacularly choreographed. You have seen some of the bus fight scenes in the trailer, but there are other high stake fight scenes that will also leave you breathless.You knew you were going to watch this movie when it came out. My review is just to tell you that yes, it is everything you expected and wanted it to be. I personally never doubted Kevin Feige. Now go watch this movie and let it knock your socks off.P. S. - This movie has a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene, so make sure you catch those.\",\n",
              " \"Shang-Chi's origin story starts with his father Xu Wenwu. Xu Wenwu is one of the many positive aspects, that make this movie such a joy to watch and such a surprising MCU movie: Xu Wenwu as the antagonist is a very complex character, you see his good and understand what motivates him to become the villain in this story.Shang-Chi is a very complex character, too, being drilled by his father to become an assassin by the age of 14 and getting the final mission to avenge the murder of his loving mother. But he got himself a new identity and name in the U. S., earns some money with part-time jobs and enjoys karaoke nights with his girlfriend.Until the past catches up with him and starts a highly enjoyable, action heavy, fantasy Blockbuster with stunning visuals (camera and FX), excellent fight scene choreography, great soundtrack, great chemistry between the actors/characters, a lot of surprises, some asian lore and just a great entertaining story of the MCU.Some references to other MCU movies and stories appear (references to Iron Man part 3 and Doctor Strange part one), but all in all this movie can stand on his own and that's a welcome surprise, too.The makers of this movie did a great job. Can't wait for the sequel.Highly recommended.\",\n",

The film had good representation of the Chinese culture and good visuals, but the plot was very indirect, full of gaps and unexplained things, shallow characterising.

Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction.The main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao.Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score.',\n",

There were some familiar faces in the movie, some that had been spoiled for me.Visuals were top notch, it was colorful, vibrant, coherent and just pure insanity at the third act.It is entertaining, sad, wholesome, and extremely rewatchable.

He's got such range and doesn't take himself too seriously and that makes him perfect.Great fight scenes, ok origin story, but a little predictable unfortunately.Hopefully the next movie will get a little more attention to keeping the audience guessing at least a little.Watch and enjoy, even if you see it coming.\",\n",
              " 'A friend saw this shortly after it came out and said he wouldn\\'t mind rewatching it, leaving me rather surprised. A couple of days later another friend dragged us out to see this, at a 4dx screening, no less. I got burnt out on capeshit after \"Ant-Man\", but this looked possibly interesting enough to be enjoyable.Aside from the overwhelming shaking of the 4dx chairs, the film itself is a plothole-ridden nonsensical mess, led by unlikeable characters and a complete waste of its two most famous cast members, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh. As can be anticipated from modern high-budget films, it\\'s also laden with impressive CGI and good-looking visuals, and the monsters are cool. It\\'s just a shame that it\\'s such a waste. The ratings must be artificially inflated as well, as there\\'s no way anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature would actually think this is a good film. But let\\'s get into some more details.Starting from the opening, we\\'re introduced to our unremarkable protagonist and the annoying female lead. \"Katy\" is as useless, annoying, infantile, and uncharismatic as one could imagine. I couldn\\'t have written a more grating character if I tried. On top of her, we\\'re given some very awkward, stilted dialogue that was probably supposed to be cutesy or something, but fails dramatically. After the end of the first act, which terminates with the bus sequence, the film becomes slightly more palatable. Instead of cringing and facepalming and wondering why, exactly, I\\'d spent £16 on this trash, I could at least watch the thing.Then we get into the nonsensical. After his mother got killed by the mob, Shang-Chi trained hard for years before getting sent to avenge her death. He killed her murderer, but then decided to feel bad, run away to the US and abandon his ten-year-old sister whom he loved, after telling her he\\'d be back in three days. His sister, who \"taught herself better\" just by watching the real fighters train, ran away 6 years later and founded an underground fighting ring in Macau all by herself with no money or support from anyone. Right. Shang-Chi\\'s dad didn\\'t actually want to kill his kids when he sent his mercs to fight them (including the big guy with the blade-hand), he actually wants his children\\'s help to find their mum, who\\'s allegedly still alive. They run away from the dad, stealing some BMW hatchback instead of a Land Rover or a Jeep for a trip into the Chinese outback. Conveniently, the car\\'s turn circle happens to be just the one needed to traverse a perilous \"living\" forest maze that \"eats\" stragglers. Our heroes find the late mum\\'s village, train for ONE day, and defeat all evil, including the dangerous merc army bent on burning the village down.Nothing in the paragraph above, and little in the film in general, makes any sense, including the fact that the bad guys show up to the village---the village they want to slaughter the population of---with stun batons and shock crossbows. I guess assault rifles wouldn\\'t have quite stood up to the good guys\\' \"dragon-forged\" staves. Katy, the annoying American-born character who looks significantly out of shape, trains archery for a handful of hours before letting a much cooler character get his soul sucked out (RIP Master Guang Bo, I\\'ll remember you) before landing the single lucky arrow needed to dispatch the eldritch boss-monster from half a kilometre away. She\\'d never be able to draw a real bow, let alone hit any target at all.Shang-Chi himself also trains for a few hours before defeating his dad and his rings against all odds, but the flashbacks showing him training with his mum as a kid at least allow me to suspend disbelief sufficiently to go with it. What I can\\'t go with is the fact that Shang-Chi takes a full ring-empowered gut punch beforehand, which propels him some fifty metres, and would have ruptured his spleen or stomach. He\\'s dead, Jim. I don\\'t care about your plot armour.The final sequence also included so much seat shaking (4dx) that I could barely follow what was going on with the eldritch monster. 4dx was fine in \"Alita: Battle Angel\", but whoever the poor sod responsible for programming this film\\'s effects was, he must have been out of his mind.The worst part of this is that the story has potential and could have been handled better if someone actually tried to make it logical. What, am I supposed to \"turn my brain off\"? I can\\'t \"turn my brain off\" because I actually have one. As a writer, I\\'d be laughed out of the room if I were to write a script as nonsensical as this. Guess that doesn\\'t apply to blockbusters for some reason...Michelle Yeoh is completely wasted in an insignificant role as Shang-Chi\\'s aunt. Ben Kingsley is back as his \"Iron Man 3\" role, a dumb Englishman theatre actor providing comic relief alongside Katy; a role that I recall people perceived as an insult to the character of the Mandarin when \"Iron Man 3\" came out. The sole difference between his and Katy\\'s jokes is that I actually chuckled at a couple of his.A 4.5 is what I\\'d give, and I\\'d probably round it up to a 5, as the visual spectacle is decent, albeit dragged way down by the sheer inanity of the script. This unnaturally high rating, however, merits rounding mine down. I can\\'t accept the rating is real. If it is, then people must be too willing to slobber up all the flashy corporate sludge thrown their way, which would be saddening.',\n",

It means a lot to Asian-Americans to finally be put in the spotlight, and by a juggernaut like the Marvel machine no less.Went to see a late night showing on Thursday, Sept 2nd, technically a day in advance of the official release date. Happy to say the movie did not disappoint. I've watched so many Hong Kong style movies over the years and the Shang-Chi film-making team did a spectacular job of importing that authentic, Asian-flavor of film-making. They did the kind of research I've come to expect from Marvel's creative team, and let this team leave their own distinct Chinese style from using Mandarin-speaking dialogue in strategic moments, to the very distinct style of Chinese-influenced music (totally awesome!), and the kung-fu sequences on the scaffolding, which is something you see in many of the old school Kung Fu movies. Michelle Yeoh, in particular, acted in many a movie in this vein back many years ago.The filmmakers did a great job of melding old-style, Authentic Chinese Kung Fu cinema and themes (father-son tension, motherly devotion, male prioritized over female, etc .) with current Asian-American themes (underachieving children and over-expecting parents, general confusion in American society) and combining everything in the context of a fantasy-action movie with trademark Marvel humor to lighten things up.I was a fan of the special effects throughout the movie, and thoroughly enjoyed the ending sequence as well. Like other reviewers, I loved the opening fight sequence between Tony Leung and Fala Chen. It's wonderful to see that Tai Chi - style of fighting introduced in a Western, blockbuster movie.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a great movie but with Shang-Chi, I think Marvel achieved something more in melding disparate parts and taking on much more in bringing together cultures, generations and viewpoints in the context of a MCU superhero action movie. The next time we see Shang-Chi, there's no doubt most of us - moviegoers of all colors and cultures - we will be happy to see him again.\",\n",

You see with this movie that the main character isn't a skilled martial artist to begin with and it becomes embarrassingly obivious with the fight scene with Michelle Yeoh, who is an actual talented fighter. They had to cut multiple times and add CGI magic to make him look good. They lost me completely when they started to go crazy on cartoon fantasy and cheap chinese lore.

It's fine if that's what you watch the movie for, but for other people like me I've seen enough of it to not still want more of the same. If Marvel movies were noodles, they all taste pretty much the same for me. But this one gives a special ingredient that you can't help notice make it so different from the other noodles in the menu. That ingredient is Tony Leung.Besides that, the story has considerably more depth than your usual Marvel movies. It touches the subject of families, and how they're important whether or not you like them.I'd be surprised if any Shang-Chi sequels would top this anytime soon. Tony Leung is one of a kind.\",\n",

Fights scenes were captivating and beautiful, with superb special affects on top of the actual martial arts. With the Eternals coming up, Marvel is clearly upping its CGI and special affects making much more cinematographic films.My only complaint was the ending, went from one of Marvel's best into Godzilla.

First off, I loved all the characters, such as Shang-Chi, Katy, Xu Wenwu, Xialing, Razor Fist, Death Dealer, the return of Trevor Slattery, Morris, and of course Master Guang Bo. The actors for all these characters were also perfect. They suited their roles perfectly. In my opinion, this movie had some of the best supporting characters in the MCU. I also loved the action. It was absolutely amazing, there were some points in the movie where I felt like I was watching a martial arts movie. The stunts and the choreography were perfect, I couldn't have asked for anything more. The effects in this movie were also stunning. The moving forest, the mythical creatures (especially the dragon), and the effects used on the Ten Rings were super cool. The effects in this movie were some of the best in the MCU. Lastly, I also loved the plot, it just sat really well with me.This movie was like nothing we have ever seen before in the MCU. It was very unique and a nice twist for Marvel. The first Credit Scene was also very interesting and might have set up phase 4 in the MCU. This was a great movie, and I definitely recommend going to see it, even if you aren't a Marvel fan.\",\n",
              " \"This movie is not for everyone.I would like to preface this by saying that I was really thrilled to have an Asian superhero on the big screen. The trailers looked fantastic and I was hoping Marvel/Disney could supplement the visuals and fight choreographies with a good storyline well set into the preexisting MCU.Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.The visuals are stunning as expected. The fight scenes are great too. But the story is a mixed bag.It starts off as a family drama between Shang-Chi, his father and his sister. That would all be good and indeed it was, I really enjoyed the first half or so of the movie. Even despite the main villain (or supposedly the main one at that point in the story) being a bit bland in my opinion, certainly for a 1000-year-old conqueror and mastermind wielding incredibly powerful artifacts of unknown origin (sidenote: the rings turn out to not do much beside being hurled at enemies like projectiles with cool light effects; in other words their powers are really not explored or represented well at all).The second half (when they discover the mystical village) is when things go absolutely bonkers. If the story kept revolving around the family of the protagonist, it would be all good. But for whatever reason someone decided to throw a complete oddball into the movie in a form of soul-eating demons (?) which, without much explanation or backstory (the only thing we know about them is that they exist), instantly assume the role of the main bad against whom everyone (including the previous main villain and his henchmen) must fight. At this point I was just sitting there amazed by the visuals and absolutely confused by what was actually happening as I wasn't sure if the main fight was Shang-Chi against his dad, Shang-Chi against the soul-eating demon, The Great Protector dragon against the demon, Shang-Chi, his sister and his friend Katy against the demon...you get the point.The camoes of other MCU characters also felt forced. Wong was fighting Abomination, sure, but why? We never find out and it's hinted that they are actually pals. Does that mean Secretary Ross just occasionally misplaces Abomination for friendly sparring with a sorcerer then? Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner also appear, briefly examining the rings which apparently have some kind of a beacon in them. Again, completely out of nowhere but perhaps a promise for the next movie where we might actually find our what the hell is going on with these things (which again seem only as a collection of cool deadly mini frisbees in the movie).Am I glad that I went to watch it in a cinema? Yes. Do I think the character has a lot of potential for the future movies? Absolutely. But as of right now, Shang-Chi has been one of the most underwhelming introductions of a new superhero within the MCU to date.\",\n",

              " \"Xu Wenwu might just be Marvel's best villain. He has done unforgivable things, but motives are entirely sympathetic. The movie does a great job of showing him as a human being and not just some agent of evil. Part of that is the writing, but a huge chunk of the credit goes to Tony Leung's performance.All of the performances are top-notch. Despite taking place in such a heightened reality, they all feel very grounded and human. The friendship and love between Shang-Chi and Katy in particular feels completely natural, especially in those scenes at her home in San Francisco.Hong Kong action films have a reputation for a kind of creativity that a lot of Hollywood films lack. Traditionally a Hollywood fight scene could change it's setting, or the people in it, and you wouldn't notice a difference, because they're planned without taking the character or environment into account. In Hong Kong action they use the character's clothes, everyday objects, parts of the environment, so that particular fight could only have taken place with those particular characters in those particular environments. Hollywood's gotten better at it over the years, and Shang-Chi is a wonderful example. You couldn't transplant that bus fight between Shang-Chi and Razorfist onto a dock, or swap out Razorfist for Bushwacker. They also go all-in on the balletic Wuxia style fight choreography, with water and leaves and other elements of the environment flowing along with the fighter's movements.Like all MCU films, it drags a bit in the tail end with it's very long battle filled with CGi performances. The use of large empty arenas - the gate platform, the lake, the sky - makes it feel a little less grounded, and a little more Hollywood than the other battle scenes. It would have been nice for them to have some more distinct features for the characters to interact with - statuary like the story wall shown earlier in the film, for example. An especially wasted opportunity for the parts of the battle taking place in the village, which was full of architecture and decoration that could have been put to creative use. But there's still enough quality fight choreography to keep you interested.There's also a couple of fun post-credits sequences - I was already all-in on any Shang-Chi sequels, but these were wonderful teasers for what may be coming.\",\n",

              " 'I once said after watching Black Panther, that it would be cool if there was an all Asian cast similar to it. There were some all Asian cast movies like Crazy Rich Asian (2018), but that is a romcom, and Mulan (2020), but that was bad. In comes Shang Chi which is the first Asian lead Superhero movie ever. The premise is \"Martial-arts master Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) confronts the past he thought he left behind when he\\'s drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization\". So does Shang Chi succeed in giving us a good all Asian cast big blockbuster or is it just another failed attempt?Firstly, the action sequences and choreography are some of the best from Marvel since Captain America and the Winter Soldier (2014). Martial arts are the focus of the action scenes in Shang Chi and they are beautifully choreographed. We get the classic wire-fu/floating style of Crouching Tiger but we also get some Jackie Chan style with the utilization of the environment for the action. Each action scene is memorable and stunning to watch. Additionally, the action scenes avoid using lots of cuts and shaky cam which I was so grateful for. It is also clear that the actors themselves rehearsed the choreography making the fights feel more believable and gratifying. It does become a more typical MCU action sequence by the third act but even that is still pretty enjoyable even if it isn\\'t as good as the first two acts.The cinematography by Bill Pope (Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2 and 3, Scott Pilgrim) is also excellent in Shang Chi. Skyscrapers and forests in Marvel movies have never looked as good as it has in Shang Chi. Bill pope and director Destin use the lighting and colours very effectively and allow for some genuinely beautiful shots. The music score by Joel P. West is also pretty good. Joel utilizes more electronic sounds and pop/rap songs for the scenes in the city but uses more traditional Asian instruments for the mystical areas. Joel\\'s score captures the scene and the pop/rap songs themselves are also quite good albeit not as memorable as the Weeknd or Lamar from Black Panther. I also love the story and exploration of \"family\" with Shang Chi whilst not using Asian stereotypes. It also doesn\\'t overuse humour like in Marvel\\'s previous outing, Black Widow (2021), where they use jokes every couple of minutes and ruin a serious scene. Shang Chi thankfully avoids doing this, thus allowing the emotion of a scene to linger longer. There are still jokes though but they are genuinely quite funny.Furthermore, Simu Liu is charismatic, charming and cool as the titular character Shang Chi. I think Marvel succeeds again in the casting department as Simu Liu delivers on making me believe that this guy is a top tier martial artist. I also think Simu gives a good performance during the more emotional moments as well. His chemistry with Awkwafina who plays Shang Chi\\'s friend Katy is great too. The banter between Shang Chi and Katy is some of the funniest scenes and makes me believe that those two were friends for years. However, Tony Leung who plays the main villain Wenwu (the real Mandarin) is the one that steals the show. Tony Leung is just phenomenal as he can convey the exact emotions of his character just through body language alone, it is just masterful acting. My biggest worry with MCU origin movies is that the villains are lacklustre but Shang Chi does not fall into this. Wenwu is very sympathetic but also extremely fearsome. He is also the father of Shang Chi which makes the conflict between them feel more meaningful and tragic. Wenwu is not a straight-up evil person as he does still have good in him and I like that.Unfortunately, Shang Chi suffers from having the 3 villain problem. Razorfist played by Florian is Wenwu\\'s henchman and he doesn\\'t get any backstory. I don\\'t mind him that much though as he is mostly there to chase Shang Chi like a 007 henchman. There is also a scene where he does seem visibly worried about Wenwu\\'s health which gives him some character depth. On the other hand, the 3rd villain Death Dealer who is a mysterious assassin of Wenwu is a massive disappointment. He looks very cool and visibly distinct from other ten ring members and is relevant to Shang Chi\\'s past but amounts to absolutely nothing.Moreover, there is also a 3rd hero to Shang Chi and Katy with Shang Chi\\'s sister Xialing played by Meng\\'er Zhang. She doesn\\'t get enough interactions with Shang Chi, Katy or her father Wenwu and that feels like a waste. It\\'s a shame as her interactions with both Shang Chi and Katy are enjoyable and she also doesn\\'t interact with her dad Wenwu which is just a missed opportunity for her character. The movie also has a pacing issue as it slows down significantly in the second act. It just featured a lot of talking, exposition and flashbacks which I felt could have been cut down by a couple of minutes.Overall, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the all Asian cast movie I have been waiting for. It delivers on the action, story and characters while being an exciting new addition to the MCU. I can\\'t wait to see more of Shang Chi and finally get to see an Asian in the Avengers team.',\n",

The film itself is from the USA and Australia. Marvel Studios. The film lasts more than two hours, but it looks in one breath.The plot jumps into the past in periods, revealing the biography of the hero.Summing up, I want to say the film was very interesting to watch and not boring.

The main plot elements are dull, daddy issues, resentful sister, side-kick jester girlfriend.

Simu Liu is fine in the role of Shang Chi who must challenge his father from unleashing a terrible foe.Tony Leung makes his English language debut as Wenwu, a far more compelling and intriguing character then his son, with Leung giving a refreshingly subtle performance.Awkwafina is fine as Shang Chi's friend Katy but her generic arc lets her down. Meng'er Zhang plays Shang Chi's sister, Xialing who is also far more interesting then her titular brother but lacks the screentime to really be fleshed out.The ensemble do solid work with notable standouts being Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen with a very funny Ben Kingsley and a much welcomed Benedict Wong.The film soars during the rather intimate scenes between Wenwu and his wife Leiko but these scenes are soon traded for large scale battles with ugly green screen backgrounds.Aside from some intriguing post credits scenes, the film leaves you wanting more.

              " 'Shang Chi has a hallmark of being a big budget film, but it missed the mark in its attempt to be simultaneously an Asian martial arts film and a marvel film.On the positive side, the animations and the choreography are really well-done, and they demonstrate significant amount of planning and thought. However, the film lacks coherence as it intertwines sharply opposing scenes from a fight club in Macau to a peaceful fantasy Chinese village to downtown San Francisco. Comedy is used to punctuate the film, but they feel very out of place in a movie about a Chinese American aiming to kill his father, an idea that is so opposed to the ordinary Chinese-American worldview that the film should deserve more gravity. The costumes evoke a feeling of the characteristically ineffective attempt by Hollywood to mix Eastern and Western styles. In the village scene, bright artificially-coloured clothes contrast with the natural objects surrounding them (wood statues, old temples, trees, and magical creatures).Additionally, the movie is somewhat cliché, unrealistic, and illogical. The back story is one involving a long-vanquished evil threatening to come back, and the true vanquisher of such evil already lays under a a lake and (presumably) would have prevented the evil from coming back even without the protagonist\\'s help. The side character predictably must be the one who saves the village at the critical moment despite having no prior training in archery whatsoever. Have I become too grown up to appreciate such a storyline? Marvel cannot simply hide its shoddy plot work by pre-empting the critics in the bar scene. Every major scene in the movie have significant similarity with some previous movies. The fight ring was in spiderman; the village was in Kungfu Panda; Fights in buses and scaffoldings have been done countless of times before.So what\\'s new? What makes this movie special? On a martial arts standpoint, it pales in comparison to Tony Leung\\'s previous films. On an \"Asian empowerment\" standpoint, it lacks authenticity and its fantastical nature prevents any serious message from being conveyed. Indeed, the viewers are left wondering whether this movie champions the family or the freedom from it.The characters development is also lackluster. They were the ones who scorn social expectations and the ones who wish to have fun. How did they transition to people who will risk their lives to protect a village?Overall, Shang-Chi seems to disappoint.5/10.',\n",

              " 'For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson\\'s Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . \"Black Panther\" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn\\'t have to be so beige. \"Captain Marvel\" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with \"Black Panther\", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they\\'re used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero\\'s journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T\\'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton\\'s material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu\\'s comedic instincts light up the room.Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in \"In the Mood for Love.\" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee\\'s \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou\\'s \"House of Flying Daggers.\" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there\\'s also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi\\'s emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.When allowed to be its own film, \"Shang-Chi\" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can\\'t break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It\\'s a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I\\'ve come to expect that level of disappointment.Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale.',\n",

              " \"Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.I'm not even exaggerating, I have been a follower of Marvel since my teenage days, suffice it to say, Through many ups and downs I keenly witnessed all of their works over the years. Trust me when I say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around.Excluding their typical set-up for a Comicbook blockbuster, Shang-Chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all-time high here. The way this story has been told, it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (Especially, compared to the last few projects Marvel has had come up with).Other than the apparent masteries in its Audio-Visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement, a different outlook on family & self-acceptance. And guess what? It never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment.Another praiseworthy characteristic is the Action sequences or to be precise, all the Choreography behind! An incredible show for the Martial Arts fans and yeah FYI Simu Liu (Shang-Chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts, all by himself; that is amazing Isn't it?Pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however, I do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions.To start with, Shang-Chi's estranged father (Played by a veteran, Tony Leung Chiu-wai);\\nThe writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! Don't know about you, but for the most part, I was rather uncertain about what should I exactly feel about this guy! Should I be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? Gotta say this dilemma got the better of me.Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top.\",\n",

This movie is like that. Not too many side plots, no going down the rabbit hole trying to keep up with this and that. This was a straight story line with great character building. While there is a ton of CGI I felt it wasn't overly done; it was used when needed and was not overbearing. I have to give props the Awkwafina, as well. She did a great job keeping up with the heavily driven scenes.

The lore of the world is interesting.Unfortunately, there is quite a lot I didn't care for. The run time is really long for the content you're getting: my gf was asleep for the last hour.

The final half hour with all of the giant CGI monsters just did not feel right for this movie. Watching a giant dragon fight a giant demon felt pretty over the top, and I am still confused as to where all of this lore fits in with what we already know about the MCU.There was a lot to like and a lot that took me out of the movie, which sucks because I really wanted to love this movie.

Wenwu, also known as The Mandarin, heads a criminal organisation called The Ten Rings, which was introduced in the first Iron Man movie. He is a man tormented by an insatiable lust for power, which somehow gets submerged under his love for his wife but then resurfaces after her death as something even more twisted and vicious. Wenwu is one of the more tragic villains in the MCU and Leung plays him with a melancholic charisma that doesn't let up even in the climax as several CGI creatures twist and snarl and prey on everything in their path.

              " 'The introduction of new superheroes into the cinematic universe has always been accompanied by reactions from the audience. People who are not familiar with comics take a long time to adapt to new characters on the screen. There was a time when not everyone knew even Thor. The Guardians of the Galaxy have been cleverly introduced with humor to further develop their inherent style of comedy and adventure. But what about Asian rental? After all, the profit of the Middle Kingdom brings a lot, so the director Destin Daniel Cretton raised the comics from the dusty shelf.Before us seems to be a typical Marvel movie, but after the large-scale \"The Avengers\" it is perceived dryly and narrowly. Easter eggs, of course, are shooting from everywhere. Yes, a few cameos will pleasantly delight fans, but if the tape had been separately about Shang-Chi and the legend, and not with a postscript to the MCU, it would have turned out much better. To seed the plot, the opening story of the ten rings serves as an explanation of the artifact and a representation of the antagonist.The amusement ride introduces us to Shang-Chi and his girlfriend Katie. While the introduction of the characters is accompanied by routine episodes, leading to a showdown in the kung fu style in order to somehow entice, there is no excitement inherent in KVM films. The story of the return to his homeland, the fight against the ghosts of the past and the clouding of the mind of the main villain give the journey and disclosure of the hero. Constant flashbacks somehow clarify the situation, hence the uncomfortable perception.It was unexpected to meet Emil Blonsky - aka Abomination. Thirteen years have passed since The Incredible Hulk, and now we meet again. Such vivid and colorful underground battles between the heroes complement this story with a general view of the universe after Thanos\\' snap. To add Shang-Chi to the magic branch of the CME, Wong meets us with his portal rings. The fight against the past and the disclosure of an ancient legend is accompanied by drama, regular flashbacks and a funny play on Mandarin and the events of the third \"Iron Man\". Actually, Trevor Slattery visited the plot of this MCU series.The picture tries to ascribe all the events already known, either playfully playing on previous films, then approaching the new artifact with all seriousness. The key location, which both reveals the prophecy and explains the legend of ancient evil, sends us to Narnia. Seriously, a magical land with fantastic creatures (Newt Scamander has already left) refers to all family, adventure films about the struggle between good and evil. In addition to the Chronicle of Narnia, we have here \"Bridge to Terabithia\", \"Spiderwick: The Chronicles\", \"Inkheart\", \"Jumanji\", but not like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. An epic fight at the end - as it should be, demonstrating the power of the rings and setting yourself on the path of a warrior.Entertainment, which is set to show action, a magical world, battles and acceptance of your past. No sense of connection with previous films. Despite the references and cameos, the film should be taken as an individual project. The post-credits scene already reveals familiar faces and attributes ten rings to common magical artifacts in Kamar Taj.Actor Simu Liu looked simple and new. If, for example, the first performance of Doctor Strange was accompanied by the already familiar Benedict Cumberbatch, then Shang-Chi does not boast of this. The target audience has already thinned noticeably. In addition, the eternal problem of the MCU is raised - no one knew about the threat, except for the heroes of the new picture. Okay Nick Fury (or Skrulls), but the Ancient One, Doctor Strange? Such a massive threat, which actually had to somehow react to Thanos\\' click. In general, we are again stepping on the same rake, ignoring our own rules.',\n",

Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fuIts a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it.

Even with a complex story line, it had a lot of action (usually complex story lines have a lot of lead in and are slow to warm up, but this definitely was not the case). And after watching Michelle Yeong be Miss Mean Mom-in-law in Crazy Rich Asians, it was so beautiful and wonderful to see her as nurturing auntie and just a complete bad-ass with her martial arts (I missed her days of Crouching Tiger, I'll admit).Simu Liu was beyond amazing. His chemistry, humor, and not to mention the way he kicked ass on screen, was so damn entertaining. And finally, a movie where AAPI are the heroes. What else could I ask for? The cherry on top was Awkwafina's blunt ass humor and the way she broke uncomfortable silences with her awkwardness. Gotta love it.I'd definitely see this movie again. One of the best Marvel movies I've seen thus far. I can't wait to see where the story line goes, what's up with the sister, and I mean...with Wong being there, Dr. Strange's future appearance is inevitable. I can't wait!!! Such a great cliffhanger.\",\n",

              " \"One of the real standouts for me in the movie was the fights scenes. The MCU is not really known for having interesting fight scenes and really most of them are just bland and cliché but Shang-Chi brought something new and I loved it. Every single fight scene was so well done and paced super well and Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed this, did an amazing job directing the fight scenes in this movie. The fight scenes in this movie were probably the best part especially since you can tell that all of the actors in this movie, especially Simu Liu, did most of the stunt work themselves. It's also insane to think that other than this movie Simu Liu has only really acted in one other thing but you could barely tell. He played Shang-Chi so well and brought so much emotion that everybody can easily relate to and love him. Honestly, everybody did an amazing job acting in this movie and I have to say I was skeptical with Awkwafina, who plays Katy, but she proved me wrong. But for me, the real scene-stealer was Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, who plays Xu Wenwu, as the villain. The villains in Marvel movies are mediocre at best but he decided to change that with this movie. Xu Wenwu was such an intriguing villain that the audience can easily sympathize with and relate to him. The cinematography in this movie is gorgeous to look at and you can see the detail that was put into it. Depending on where the movie is at the lighting reflects that area. I will say though is that this movie has a bit of slower pacing that at times does work in its favour but in other parts, I very much was wanting the movie to hurry up. In the end, Shang-Chi is such a heartfelt Marvel movie that does have some issues but is still enjoyable.\",\n",

The action was awesome the visuals both practical and CG were awesome and the story wasn't over complicated or too simple. Saw it with friends and we enjoyed it start to finish. Simu Liu and Awkwafina have great chemistry and Tony Leung Chiu-wai is very relatable and relatable as a villain and person. Over all I love the movie the most for feeling both down to earth and human while also being full Marvel wonder. Like Iron Man, the way it opens a wide and beautiful future for Marvel leaves me optimistic and excited.\",\n",
              " \"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a great Marvel Studios film. The story was fun and engaging, and was surprisingly emotional, with Shang Chi's relationship with his father and sister. The father's death was surprisingly impactful, and which the movie did well. One issue with the story was that the film would take a pause with the plot for flashbacks and exposition. They do make the film boring and slow at times, but there's not many. Plus, the flashbacks can be helpful\\nThe visuals and action scenes in this film are, in my opinion, some of the best action scenes in the MCU. The film takes advantage of the martial arts action to deliver epic fight scenes. The visuals were also stellar. The CGI was top notch, and the backgrounds were some of the best from Marvel.The Characters were all fun to watch, and throughout the movie, you feel engaged in these characters. Shang Chi and Katy's chemistry is great. The villain was a great antagonist in this film. Some characters were bland and forgettable, but the good ones shine the most throughout the film.Overall, it's a great MCU film with a compelling story, great fights and visuals, and engaging characters. IT can be a bit slow at times, but the film is a must watch. MY favorite MCU film since Far From Home.\",\n",
              " \"This movie gave me hope that there are still bright days ahead for the MCU. Shang-Chi is very different from what we've seen in the past but it's so good. It's visually stunning and the action sequences are thrilling. It had the quality of action that I was expecting from Black Panther. The ten rings are fascinating to watch in use. There were such epic moments that I had to rewind and watch again a few times. I really wish I could have seen this is IMAX. It's one of the few movies that would have been a truly special experience.With a story like this one, things could have very easily taken a downward turn into the realm of cheesiness and over the top. But it's all done so well. The comedy and serious moments are balanced really well. There are some real laugh out loud moments but the movie never feels silly. The back-flashes are interesting and meaningful.One of my favorite surprises of this movie, is that it redeems the worst villain twist of the MCU. You know Marvel and Disney have done well when we look forward to seeing these new characters in the future.\",\n",

              " \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) :\\nBrief Review -Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.\",\n",

He groups up together along with his excellent pal Katy (Awkwafina) and his estranged sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) to forestall Wenwu for good.Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings mark MCU's first Asian-led superhero film. There had been Asian characters before, inclusive of Wong (Benedict Wong) from Doctor Strange and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) from Thor. But they have constantly been sidekicks, flunkeys, or comedian relief.Wenwu is a powerful crime lord who runs an evil empire constructed across the energy of ten historical earrings that he makes use of to generate blasts of energy.Shang-Chi is a heart-warming tale syringed with humor. Co-writer-director Destin Daniel Cretton knows his circle of relative dynamics and superbly units the tone. Despite the humanity on show, it is the revolutionary martial arts that are the USP. The movement would not depend closely on virtual trickery withinside the actual world.The chemistry among the actors is palpable, exuding an actual feel of a located own circle of relatives. The film's actual villain is grief, pushed via way of means of Wenwu at the cost of his children.Shang-Chi is a prevailing mixture of the Chinese way of life and a hit Marvel formula. Despite pacing issues, it supplies a highly unique step withinside the proper path for Asian representation. Simu Liu, Awkwafina, and Tony Leung deliver multi-faceted characters to life.\",\n",

Highly suggest you see it in a theatre, for the full experience!The loss of the one star is because as an Asian martial arts movie, it doesn't entirely live up to the greats that have come before it (Crouching Tiger, Hero, etc). Saying it is close though, is praise enough!Very excited this group is part of the MCU, excited to see more!\",\n",
              " \"The first third was really enjoyable, excellent pacing, well timed jokes and incredible hand-to-hand-combat scenes. I already thought about seeing it a second time but the rest of the movie had a completely different feel to it. The second part for me was a drastic change (basically after the group is captured). Awkwafina, who was good in the beginning began to annoy with too many jokes and goofy moments and she did feel quite out of place which continued for the rest of the movie. The OG Mandarin appearing was a nice callback but he as well felt way too goofy and is just a cheap comic relief without actual importance to the story. You could probably cut 30min or so of less imports scenes without hurting continuity of the film. The final part was surprisingly different than any other MCU final but still came of as underwhelming to me because I really didn't need another CGI monster fight (although Shang-Chi's dragon looked good) and all in all the whole ending was a bit too much of everything. First you got the village fighting the Ten Rings while Shaun begins to fight his dad (this fight goes on for quite a while and could have easily been the end fight) who later opens a gate which leads to more fighting between humans and monsters and monsters and other creatures - you get what I'm trying to say. At some point you just want closure and as I already said, this final part really drags.Sadly some parts of the movie looked way more immersive than others and what also took away some fun for me were the trailers that showed way too much of the movie which takes away a lot of excitement (e.g. Abomination scene). It almost reminded me of some old MCU trailers where they basically showed the whole movie.The music did remind me a bit of Black Panther since it's a mixture of classical/culturally inspired music and modern pop songs, I definitely enjoyed it.Overall Shang-Chi is still a good movie to watch because it has some talented new actors playing interesting new characters (I really liked Razorfist), a brilliant fight choreography and some cool set-pieces. Sadly it's clever and quick beginning forces the last hour +/- to feel kinda slow and unbalanced while the ending is a thing of personal preference.

The merging of different components and changing the storyline from the comics has been common in the MCU but none of them is as unique as shang chi. I'd say if they brought the original shang chi from the comics, then it would've been a mediocre movie.

The main villain Xu Wenwu is supposedly monstrous yet somehow his story ark makes him less scary and mostly just pitiable. The other characters are mostly good but they are smaller roles.The only times I got excited were when we got to see classic Chinese legends brought to life and China is where the story should have stayed. The only reason we start in San Francisco is to justify speaking English. I did like that they mostly spoke Chinese when it was appropriate but they could just have set it in China and spoken English throughout.. or even better Chinese throughout.I wish I could be excited at this new character in the MCU, but it didn't start very promisingly.\",\n",

Very americanized and people-pleasing take on the character. The movie has it's strong points like Tony Leung as the Mandarin. He feels like the only genuinely real character in the movie whom I can relate to. You can feel his every emotion and he is overall the best thing about this movie as so many have said. I actually enjoyed the original Shang-Chi comics because of their deep philosophies and introspective queries, plus the groundbreaking way they mixed action with interesting stories. This movie is lacking in that department. Generic martial arts action we have seen before, boring story for the most part, too many forced jokes and try hard laugh-inducing scenes, and westernization of Chinese culture. All-star Michelle Yeoh makes an appearance in the third act and does her famous tai-chi and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon schtick. Wong also appears and is fun as always. Abomination was in the film for just as long as he was in the trailer. Oh yeah, and Ben Kingsley reappears as Trevor Slattery, the fake Mandarin actor from Iron Man 3 and his story since then is addressed. That little creature he had was annoying rather than the typical cute character they intend to put onto all of these movies. Overall, I expected better, so now I may just wait until the new Spider-Man comes out to go back to the theaters. This was a filler movie that felt rushed.

              " 'According to IMDB\\'s trivia page for this film (my source for most factual assertions herein), Liu tweeted in December 2018 about asking Marvel for the role of Shang-Chi. He later retweeted that original tweet on July 20, 2019, thanking them. Cretton said that a lot of contenders were considered for the lead role, but the perfect package was in Liu. \"He has the athletic abilities, but he\\'s also a terrific actor, showed fantastic chemistry with Awkwafina, is fluent in English and Mandarin and is comfortable shifting between Western and Eastern cultures.\" I couldn\\'t agree more. This movie really depended on all of those qualities, as well as his charisma and passion, and Liu has all of that and more. He has a bright future in Hollywood.Renowned Hong Kong film actor Leung was also a perfect choice to pair opposite Liu. While Leung was Cretton\\'s first instinct when thinking about who to cast as Xu Wenwu, Cretton thought that there was \"no way we\\'ll ever get him.\" Fortunately, Leung was thrilled to join the film, as he is a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). When Marvel Studios contacted Leung, they gave him full authority to invent his own background for this iteration of his character. He sought to give the character more depth and credibility: \"I tried to explore the reasons that could have led him to become who he is. He\\'s a man with history, who craves to be loved. He is a sociopath, a narcissist and a bigot, but he is also human and has a family.\" Leung displayed strength, class, leadership, tenacity, an intimidating presence, intense inner turmoil, and a surprising emotional vulnerability beneath his cold exterior. Cretton stated that he and Leung had discussed whether Wenwu (named after the Chinese dual concept of wen (civil administration) and wu (martial administration)) had the ability to love, and \"Tony emphatically said yes.\" Leung saw his character as a man who genuinely loves his family but doesn\\'t know how to show it.This movie is visually beautiful, featuring captivating sets, rich colors, and stylish costumes. The final film features over 1,700 visual effects shots. The village in Ta Lo (which is actually a region with cities, despite the featured \"monkish\" village) was especially stunning, including the fantastic creatures roaming around.The action sequences are all elite. The bus fight, in particular, is epic.This movie is also important for cultural reasons. It is Marvel Studios\\' first superhero film with an Asian leading protagonist. The first English line isn\\'t spoken until about 10 minutes into the movie, and there is a particularly inspiring conversation regarding the importance of given names in Chinese culture.Cretton, for whom Marvel films were never a goal until he heard that Shang-Chi was entering the MCU, was intent on accurately representing the richness of Asian culture. In an interview with CinemaBlend, Cretton stated that, for him, \"one of the biggest parts of this production was having all of these voices on set to say, \\'That food is not what he would have on the table, that music is not correct. If Wenwu is really from this area, he wouldn\\'t have that on the wall.\\'\"\\nShang-Chi\\'s father in the comics was a character named Fu Manchu, \"an obviously problematic deeply stereotypical character,\" according to Cretton. So, the character was rebuilt from the ground up for this film.Xialing was originally going to have a red streak hair extension, but it was dropped a month into filming, at Meng\\'er Zhang\\'s request, after she read a Teen Vogue article covering how frequently rebellious Asian women in popular media are given such an accessory.This movie is a great example that films don\\'t need to be whitewashed to be successful. It made $94.4 million in the US box office, shattering the box office records for the 4-day Labor Day weekend by beating Halloween (2007)\\'s $30.5 million record.',\n",

The storyline for this movie follows a young man and his best friend who work as parking attendants and are one day attacked by super villains. As they dig into the young man's past they discover his father is behind the attack with the purpose of hopefully brining his family back together. This movie is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (Just Mercy) and stars Simu Liu (Blood and Water), Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (Infernal Affairs), Ben Kingsley (Iron Man 3), Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians). The storyline for this movie is way better than it should be and has crazy depth around all of the characters. You really understand the what, when and why behind every circumstance and perspective. The acting is outstanding and the characters are perfectly portrayed. The special effects are awesome both in terms of the action scenes and backdrops. The dragons may have been a bit overdone; but other than that, A++++. The choreography was also excellent and seeing Yeoh in this really made me smile.

              " \"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!\",\n",

I've never heard of Simu Liu before this movie, as I'm sure most people haven't either, but he did his thing. Then there's the 2nd main character, his best friend(and potential love interest?), Katie. I'd normally find a character like this annoying, but it worked, in my opinion at least. It may have worked for me because Shang-Chi and her had amazing chemistry, and it was a type of relationship I don't see portrayed often in movies at all, so that made it even better and more fresher for me.The action was top notch. It's the Marvel movie I seen with most actual fight chorography, and actually amazing chorography. I heard one of Jackie Chan's stunt team members was the main fight chorographer, and I could see that 100 percent. There is a lot of CGI as expected from an MCU movie, but it's not an overuse of CGI. I think whenever the CGI was used, it was necessary. With the mystic stuff in this movie, CGI is the only way, but the actual fighting and close-quarters combat was actually real, they didn't unnecessarily CGI that like they usually do in other moves *cough* Black Panther *cough* MCU Spider-Man.As for the main plot, it was a little typical MCU formulaic, but still done better than most Marvel movies I've seen. Overall, highly recommend. I don't meet a lot of people who seen this movie that think it sucks. It's that good!\",\n",

The movie opens with the two of them in low paying jobs, yet somehow they are jet-set world travelers at the drop of a hat. Shang continually puts his friend in life-threatening danger.The movie is weakened by fan service. The callback to Iron Man 3 makes zero sense. Casting Ben Kingsley for comedic relief does nothing for the story.This movie all but breaks the MCU\\'s continuity and overarching story. It introduces new dimensions, races and powers without regard for existing storylines.Cameos don\\'t help. Kingsley\\'s Trevor Slattery feels about 10 years too late and most of his previous story arc from \"Iron Man 3\" and \"Hail to the King\" is negated and/or ignored.

Unfortunately, the protagonist lacked charm and his persona was split rather than conflicted. What he lacked in personality, Awkwafina more than made up for (sometimes to a a fault). The other characters were fine but forgettable, with the exception of Wenwu, who was the best part of the film.My main complaint with Shang-Chi is in the climactic third act. Introducing and destroying a villainous beast in the final 20 minutes is never a good idea. The dragon \"Dweller-in-Darkness\" felt unnecessary and distracted from the true conflict between father and son.This film is saved by the phenomenal action sequences, especially on the bus and outside the building in Macao. Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings left me excited for the next phase in the MCU from a production standpoint, but wary about the characters.',\n",

              " 'Positives:\\nThis is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don\\'t need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco \"bendy-bus\". Some great martial arts reminiscent of \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.The relationship built between Shaun and Katy is wonderful, and the actors deliver on it brilliantly: no wonder when you have the exceptional Awkwafina on the other end of it. Similarly, the relationship built between Shang-Chi and his father is powerful, thanks to some wonderful acting from Tony Chiu-Wai Leung. So good in the gripping (and erotic) \\'Lust, Caution\\', I believe this is his first English-speaking film.With the odd exception (see below), the special effects are top-notch.Negatives:\\nI thought this was 5* all the way until the final reel, when we descended into a CGI-driven \"Godzilla vs Kong\" finale. I hate CGI that\\'s just a blur of action across the screen where you\\'re struggling to understand what\\'s going on. Less would be more here for me.The movie makes extensive use of \\'flashbacks\\' and, for me, there was a bit too much heavy-handedness in their use. I muttered \"enough already\" to a few of them, since they were taking us out of the movie\\'s current narrative.There were a couple of effects that looked like the intern at the special effects company had put them together during a coffee break. An early plunge of a jeep into a forest and some rather obvious green-screen stuff in the finale. Surprised that these weren\\'t caught and redone.Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the \"Present Day\", the events of \"Avengers: Endgame\" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos\\'s \"blip\" and \"the return\". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It\\'s an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did \"Just Mercy\" in 2019).As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (\"monkeys\" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there\\'s a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.It\\'s ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi\\'s father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.This doesn\\'t seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.(For the full graphical review and video check out #onemannsmovies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok.

With a sympathetic drive to his villainy he manages to avoid the 1 dimensional template past MCU villains unfortunately fall into. His death put his story full circle.The film also manages to do a lot of world building in its 2 hour and 12 minute runtime in an impressive and not rushed way.Trevor Slaterey was a character that split the fan base in the middle when Iron Man 3 debuted but when we know the real Mandarin exists his character can be less divisive. He still remains a hilarious character and they don't forget his position as a Liverpool fan. His Planet of the Apes monologue was somewhat emotional for a kind of dumb scene and was well acted.The action is brilliant especially for the bus fight. The final fight with the rings was a fun and unique fight however the great protector vs dweller in darkness was a good looking yet somewhat boring fight that felt as if it didn't fit in the film and the hand to hand fights were brilliant.Both credit scenes are brilliant and the mid credit scene is one of the best in the MCU with appropriate cameos that leave you excited for the future. It also connects the film to the wider MCU. The second scene was great and allows excitement for the sequel to rise.Overall the film is great and has some great character moments however the final fight ends in a chi mess that perhaps didn't belong in the film.\",\n",

He hadn\\'t heard of her since he ran away from his father\\'s house, many years ago.At the hideout, Shang-Chi engages in a fight, just for exposition, against his sister, who defeats him in a matter of seconds. After that, cliché surprise, he finds out that she didn\\'t send him the McGuffin postcard...! A moment later, the villains come crashing in, and eventually capture everybody, except for Shang-Chi, who is defeated by his father in a single strike, after he arrived at the hideout a few minutes later, time enough for a lot more expository fighting.With the family forcibly reunited, back at Shang-Chi\\'s father\\'s house, we discover that he has been hearing his deceased wife calling from \"beyond,\" that \"beyond\" being in the secret village she came from, which can only be reached through magical means.Eventually, Shang-Chi and friends manage to escape and head to the secret village, with the help of Ben Kingsley and a plushy merchandise. There, they train for one day, which was enough for them to master archery, wire-fu, dragon riding and Kamesen\\'nin-sama\\'s iconic Kamehameha (TM) to defeat the father and the evil creature \"beyond\" a sealed gate, which has been luring the father into breaking the seal.Happy ending comes with a high price tag. Except for Aunt Michelle Yeoh, all other support characters die, including Shang-Chi\\'s father, after a cliché redemption. Using the inherited Ten Rings, Shang-Chi kills the evil creature, very easily, actually.An awful lot of things in this film are incoherent, unnecessary or just plain dumb.1) The bus fight: why were Shang-Chi\\'s henchmen trying to kill him, if his father wanted him alive (unless he didn\\'t, but, in that case, they could have killed him in his apartment, while sleeping, not in a stupid bus)?2) Why Shang-Chi\\'s father sent him a postcard with his sister\\'s address? He already knew where both of them were, so why kidnap them together, when picking them one at a time would\\'ve been much cheaper, faster and easier?3) Why does Shang-Chi\\'s father send minions to do things he is obviously able to do with a single strike of the Ten Rings? Actually, he usually shows up a little later just to do exactly that.4) Why cars, or helicopters? The controller of the Ten Rings can FLY, duh!5) Shang-Chi\\'s girl friend masters archery in a single day, hitting moving target at impossible distances better than warriors that have been training for thousand of years.6) Shang-Chi\\'s father couldn\\'t defeat the great evil creature, even after thousands of years of wearing ad mastering the Ten Rings, but Shang-Chi, without any previous training with them, is able to kill the creature in a single battle (using a single move, actually, digging a whole in its chest with the Rings.)7) Why did they seal the destroyer-of-worlds creature, if all they needed to do was use the Ten Rings to kill it? Shang-Chi\\'s father didn\\'t create them, he just acquired them from some undisclosed place and learned how to use them. The first encounter with his soon-to-be wife showed that she not only knew the artefacts, but knew how to control them, so why not simply use them and end the menace?8) Why Shang-Chi and not his sister? Seriously, she\\'s way better than him in the art of a-kicking, having been training non-stop for years, while he slacked in karaoke bars. She\\'s the one most likely to have mastered the Ten Rings and the Kamehameha (TM) (in a single day or otherwise.) She also should\\'ve been the one to kill the evil creature.9) What was the deal with Ben Kingsley? I mean, I liked seeing him in the film (as in any film, really,) but I couldn\\'t understand what he was doing there. Wasn\\'t Shang-Chi\\'s girl*friend the comic relief? The only thing he does is interface the communication between humans and the plushy merchandise. Any other McGuffin would have done there, or just remove it altogether, as the labyrinth itself is meaningless, as it doesn\\'t lead to the village, but to a teleportation gate made of water (don\\'t ask, just accept...)10) Shang-Chi doing the Kamehameha (TM) without saying \"kame... hame... ha!\" was very underwhelming... He could have said \"Turtle\\'s Destroyer Wave Strike\" in Chinese, if using Japanese in a Chinese-centric film was a problem...Yeah, that last one was not really a thing, but it would\\'ve been a lot funnier. Shang-Chi\\'s girl*friend actually mentions him doing the Kamehameha, for effect, so why not simply play along, or is only Deadpool allowed to break the fourth wall indiscriminately?Summarising, there was an evil creature that could have been killed using a special weapon, the Ten Rings, but, instead, was sealed behind a gate, just to release itself thousands of years later and, then, finally be properly killed by the mentioned weapon.The film is a series of excuses to tie several action-packed scenes together, without a coherent story to back them up. The titular Ten Rings are never explained, they are a McGuffin themselves, simply appearing on the first scene to introduce Shang-Chi\\'s father and put the film into motion.The action scenes themselves are tainted with too much unnecessary wire-fu, making them cartoonish and disappointing.It\\'s a big waste of Ben Kingsley\\'s dramatic/comedic energy and Michelle Yeoh\\'s martial talents.To put it in a relatable perspective, \"Shang-Chi\" was like the second half of \"Iron Man\" (2008), when all that we really wanted was that it was like the first half of it.',\n",

And it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from Bruce Lee to the Matrix, to Dragon Ball, The Last Airbender and Kung Fu Panda.Marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of Iron Man's legacy, and this seems like an earnest start for something far-removed from the likes of Spider-Man, and so on. Also makes you wonder if Awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the Shang Chi movies alone.Shang Chi is the stuff you've come to expect from Marvel Studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward. Though bigger and better seems better fitted for high-concept space operas like Infinity War and Endgame than more earthbound character-driven stories.Shang Chi's good fun, and it really succeeds in being that during its runtime.\",\n",

              " \"To start, Shang Chi is a film worth going to see. If you're a Marvel fan it'll be a film that you'll enjoy; story, links to the wider MCU, action, comedy, and visuals. Just take a look at the reviews on here and you get the idea that it's a v good MCU film, that is slightly different from others that we've seen.I thought to add a few things not mentioned in the reviews on here that struck me while I was watching;\\na. The slow motion and music/sound during the slow Mo. Something I've noticed about Chinese cinema over the past 2 decades is the over use of slow Mo to try and be poignant or emotional. It's been overdone, especially with the slightly cheesey background music to labour the point. ShangChi leans heavily on these several times and I found myself rolling my eyes more than once. Admittedly you may not notice it.B. The CGI. I thought it wasn't great, particularly at the start in the forest fight and the bus scene. It got better though, and overall the climactic fight was well rendered, if a little disorientating.C. The 'eastern' mystical stuff. They tried to shoehorn in a couple of things but honestly it's kinda like an impression that a westerner would have about 'Eastern history and culture'. It reminded me a little bit of what Marvel did with The Ancient One (a Caucasian lady in Asian clothes), and the way Danny Rand tried to spout a few mystical phrases in Iron Fist.D. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Yuen Wah. Three major players in Chinese cinema going all the way back to the 80s (I think)... It was great to see them here, particularly Tony Leung who has some of the most expressive eyes in film (I know it's a weird thing to say, but he has) and Yuen Wah who was a classmate of Jackie Chan. I would have liked to have seen more of the latter to be honest and would recommend you check him, Jackie, Sammo Hung and Yuan Biao out on YouTube.E. The fight scenes. Overall they were very good, particularly the hand to hand on the bus (before the CGI). That one was sharp, aggressive and brilliantly choreographed. The one in the forest though!!! It's was one of that have been overdone in Chinese cinema, so an eye roller for me... ie a relationship developing as a result of a fight.F. The humour was great imo and the delivery was great overall.Like I said above it's worth seeing and you'll probably enjoy it. My girlfriend (who's not watch a whole lot of Asian cinema) did. I've seen a fair share of it, from the Shaw Brothers films up to modern day, so somethings did grate on me. Did I enjoy it though? Overall, yes.\",\n",

More time needed to be put into that aspect and the amazing Marvel CGI will follow. Seems to be a trend with some Marvel movies, just making it really boring when you go deeper than surface level.\",\n",

The first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well-choreographed. The final act flexes all of the CGI dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far, with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a Marvel movie so far. This movie didn't quite hit the 8/10 for me to recommend people see it in theatres, but lets tack that up to me being tired and you go see it anyway!\",\n",

The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes.
